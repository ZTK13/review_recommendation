this is a poem i wrote after watching the recent tv documentary about the nuclear attack on hiroshima at the end of wwii. i have always been fascinated by hiroshima and nagasaki and vehemently against what happened. i have read extensively on the subject, including many novels of survivors  accounts and i still can t find a good reason to justify what happened to those poor people of japan.karen.hiroshima little boy, enola gay,you took 100,000 lives away who gave you the right to play god? to drop the bomb that stole my innocencehaunted my dreamsblackened my futureyou intruded my lifeyou polluted my mindyou crept into my soul.the city an infernothe flames of hellthe clouds of dustno water but black rainto quench your thirst with death. all those people vaporized in secondslucky to be immortalizedin the minds of the livingor as shadows -forever casting a lasting impression on stone steps. and what of the survivors?drowning in the water they need to survivetrodden into the depths by a desperate torrent ofthe more needy,the more eager. long days of waiting -as your hair disintegrates in your weak touchyour skin blistersdying from the inside outnecrosis of the livingthe death of flesh. is this really survival?no, it s only prolonging the inevitable.  don t pity those who vanished when the sky flashed white.pity those who livedjust long enoughto dieslowlypainfully. pity those who flew the planesdropped the bombsgave the orders.wonder how they sleep at nightwho can forgive themthis most cowardly of massacres?dropping their lethal cocktailtoo far away to see the facesof those they killed and poisoned. those faces that disappeared without traceonly to be rememberedas one of many -nameless faceless victimsof an unnecessary evilthat is the scourge of mankind.   copyright - klih, 2005 (karenuk)

autumn and on the hill the crimson toneto show the sun she   s not alonefor as she stalks the autumn skythe wisps of cloud go floating bythe reds that dwell within their midstare rain, and sun and ozone kissedand that is why they glow so brightto signify the end of nightand yet as they glow and look belowthey can sense the winds of autumn blowand watch the leaves that swirl aroundland free soft upon the groundthey reminisce  as leaves do witheras if they   ve looked into a mirrorfor the bounty of colour within the treesjust makes them smile and feel so pleasedthough summer now has passedand the seasons follow first to lastwe wait to see what winters bringswhen robin redbreast spreads his wingsand once again look to the skiesto see the reds of autumn riseand watch the sun set clouds alightto make our autumn mornings bright.

this can   t be a good idea, can it?the idea of publicly naming and explaining one   s circle of trust, that is.   it   s a nice idea, course.   one trusts people for reasons, and the reasons for as admirable a sentiment as trust must surely be positive.  so it seems a positive affirmation of all that is admirable in our inter-personal relations to expose them to public scrutiny.   with our cots limited to 100, however, the more one names the 100 the more conspicuous are others by their absence, and the more one cites the reasons the more apparent it becomes that not all the reasons can honestly be applied to everyone.  i fear i   m going to offend more people than i gratify with this one.so it can   t be a good idea.   but when has that ever stopped me?  61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514; doing my best to think hard and honestly about the reasons people are on my cot, i came up with the following:1.   because they seem to me to be particularly trustworthy obvious, isn   t it?   that   s what comes of hard and honest thinking     the obvious.  or maybe i   m just not skilled at it, being more accustomed to the soft and devious.   and i never claimed to be a judge of character, though one has to try.   nevertheless, i do value trustworthiness, and the fact that the following seem especially trustworthy to me is one of the reasons why i trust them:anwar, bawbaw, bigbaz, blobbyqueen, borg, coolchanty, dardalius, elainebaba, fanny, flissy, gentlegiant, gillj, hepialid, herby 30, hollyhock, jeannie, katecgreen, keeway, kirsty1,

weemam, xadoc, xalala.2.  because they regularly read and seem to like my opsonce started down the slippery slope of honesty, it   s hard to stop.   so yes, if i   m honest, i do like to be read and i   m flattered when people are flattering about my writing.   so a particularly trusting thank you to: anwar, bawbaw, belle, bigbaz, blobbyqueen, collingwood21, coolchanty, coriander, emmorticia,

liked themno doubt about it, meeting people face-to-face is a great aid to liking them, and liking them is a great aid to trusting them.  so much so that i   ve met and liked more people than i have found room for on my cot, but here are a few to be getting on with:carebear, elainebaba, emmorticia, glitterprincess, hmatt, karenuk, kirsty1, mattygroves, monsterandi, mr-zeeman, netstation, ophelia,

kirsty1, lindal, lostwitness, mattwood, mornev, mr-zeeman, muddy 250, netstation, okkaraoke, proxam, shoppinggirl, silverback, soho_black, theediscerning, xadoc.6.   because i like their stylepersonal style, that is, not just literary.  the way they present themselves, make an impact, communicate their personalities.   can it be a coincidence that all these people are female?aggapimou, alma, anya_lahiri, beatlemanic, belle, coolchanty, coriander, elainebaba, emmorticia, fanny, feebleeona, flissy, gillj, glitterprincess, helen201274, honey_bee, jessl, jillmurphy, justine, karenuk, kirsty1,

zoe_page.7.  because i   d like to think they   re still around despite all the evidence to the contraryi   m just a boy who can   t let go.   once you   re on my cot it   s very hard to break free.   you have to commit some really unspeakable crime like leaving ciao     even ceasing to read me doesn   t always do the trick.  i do regretfully remove some members from my cot after they   ve been silent for about a year, but i   m still hoping the current quiescence of the following is temporary:alma, andymcf, baskin, battiest, dardalius, elainebaba, esless, feebleeona, gentlegiant, glitterprincess, heidavey, helen201274, hepialid, hmatt, honey_bee, jeannie, justine, katecgreen, lindal, louz, netstation, ophelia, paiceyjohn, paww, serza, shoppinggirl, slyclone, steveuk, tracey_angel, truesatan, versatile, water_witch.8.   because they   re charactersof course this is related to style as in 6, and you   ll see many of the same people mentioned.   but, in my appreciation, character     an individuality of outlook and its expression - is a separate trait and its value needs to be separately recognised.alma, anya_lahiri, baskin, battiest, belle, bigbaz, carebear, christina44, coriander, dadmancat, dardalius, discerna, elainebaba, feebleeona, frkurt, gillj, glitterprincess, heidavey, hmatt, jeannie, jillmurphy, jmckitterick karenuk, kirsty1,

super_stevo, tange, tracey_angel, theediscerning, trampus, truesatan, the_mad_cabbie, versatile, weemam, wulise, xadoc,9.   because, rightly or wrongly, i feel an affinity with themwith some people, one just feels one has shared background, interests or attitudes, perhaps mistakenly, but i hope those listed will give me the benefit of the doubt.baskin, battiest, bawbaw, jillmurphy, kirsty1, monsterandi, mr-zeeman, muddy 250, netstation, proxam, suemagee.10.    because they talked me into itas i said to her at the time, i can resist anything except a forthright request from an attractive and witty woman.   i   m hoping of course that this admission will elicit more forthright requests from attractive and witty women, not necessarily to do with my cot.   meanwhile, the woman in question is:reynarda.and finally, just because: hmatt, monsterandi.  61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;   61514;

criteria who aren   t yet on my cot although i d like to include them.   my reluctance to remove people means that vacancies arise only occasionally.  give me time, give me time.and encouragement, of course.    torr 2004

this is my favourite film. it is a hilarious comedy and has you crying it is so funny. you get stitches. this is a 15 film and stars marlon wayans and shawn wayans. the film is about a kidnapping threat is held over two heiresses in the hamptons so fbi agents kevin and marcus copeland try to help out. they have to be coverted into  quot;white chicks quot; and turn into girls because the two heiresses decide they wont go because of the crash that happened at the beginning of the film. they have to party and keep there cover from anyone suspecting anything. the fbi agents have to go to parties meet the sisters who they dont like as they are also trying to get onto the cover of hamptons magazine. i would recommened this highly

i have written a poem for rachels challenge, it is based on a tree that is erected each year in my local shopping centre which has the names of all the parentless and underprivaliged children in our county.  we shoppers are asked to take a name and buy one less gift for our own families and put the money toward a gift for this unknown child.  i do this every year, and every year i see people who obviously are used to the finer things in life walk past the tree with their shopping bags from designer stores without a backwards glance.little eyes closedchildren sleep in their beddark and fair curlsfalling from these childs headssweet dreams of santariding through on his sleighdelivering presentsrudolph lighting the way.can you hear bellswhats that noise on the roof?can you here pawingcould this be the proof?time to open your eyeslets go down and seelook at the presentswhat could they be?but in other houseswhen children awakeno presents are herethere is no christmas caketheres no tree to sit roundno gifts to enjoyno family to smile atnot one single toyremember these childrenof toys they ll get nonegive a little loveto a child with no-oneso open your eyes upat the presents you seeits the love thats importantremember its free

i used to write a lot of poems, most of them are pretty morbid and far too depressing for this site  i recently wrote this one, nothing special but what the heck. comments welcome and bear in mind my type of humour the evening rain is soon to comeas clouds block out the setting sunthe stars still there, remain unseen just the odd flickerof a lonely moonbeam.bats cry out and call the nightan owl hoots from the treesa field mice scampers out of fright as the corn field rustleswith the breezein the distance a storm awakesand rumbles as it yawnsas lightening flashes through the darka demon with unseen hornsthe wind blows harder and starts to shakethe branches of the treesthe owl fly   s off into the darkand scans the field for the mouse he seesthe thunder crashesthe rooftops shakeas the hunter catches his praydespite the cries and squeals of painthe mouse ends his final daythe storm blows overas the wind calms downthe owl he wipes his beakall that remains of the tiny field mouseis a tail and a ghostly             .squeeeeeeeeeak

this album is an absolute bargain the opening track is  quot;when the going gets tough quot;. a timelass classic, famed for being the soundtrack for  quot;jewel of the nile quot;, and the video with michael douglas, kathleen turner and the ever comical danny devito  next is carribean queen, with a luring bassline which sets the pace for the rest of the album  it has all his classics,  quot;love realy hurts without you quot;  quot;suddenly  quot;etc. theres a song for every mood and billy shows how diverse he can be in this album, with feel good tunes to emotive ballads. perfect album to relax to, driving in the car, perfect summer tunes. a great pice of nostalgia, so buy this album and relax and feel greater than ever

aracaju. this is not one of the top destinations in brazil. thare not manymonuments, unless you consider the fact that the city was the 1st planned cityin brazil, to be a monument in itself. if you arrive there, do not reply on thestate tourism office, emsetur or the local centro do turismo, since the first isbased out of town, and the second is more of a crafts market. we stayed one dayonly on our way north, and went to the beach called praia atalaia nova, where wemet some local guys and played a memorable football match. we got an invitationto go to the wedding of one of them in 2 weeks time, but this was in contrastwith our schedule and had to decline. instead, we went out with them in thenight to a  forroseiro , a place where they dance the local music, forro. thisplace was very nice, it is not far from the rodoviaria, and if you ask there youshould be able to find it.

i m surprised only one other member has done a review in this catagorie   come on    we all have secret confession s of songs we like by bands/artists we can t stand, something we hate to admit.  so i shall be the second member to do it.  i hope other members decide to give it a try 10.  blue- breathe easy quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot;sorry to all blue fans out there, but i hate this band with a passion, bloody manufactured crap   oh, how i hate myself for liking this song, not just that, but one of the little twats wrote it    breathe easy is a ballad with a great little guitar tune in it, and....well...i really, really, like it   *groan*9.  willie nelson- you are always on my mind quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot;i don t actually hate the man but....well it s just not good for the street cred is it?  i love this version of the elvis presley classic.  willie nelson sings it with such raw emotion.8.  usher- you got it bad quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot;not the only song of his i like dispite hating the man    burn  was a pretty good song too.  i just think he s arrogant, and i really don t know what people see in him....apart from his deep brown eyes and six pack of course 7.   britney spears- everytime quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot;well now.... where do we start?  i have always said the girl can t sing, and her cheesy dance routines make me cringe   i would probably still say that, however,  everytime  is an exception.  written by miss spears herself (or is she still married?)  this is a great song, with violins and beautiful lyrics.6.   girls aloud- sound of the underground quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot;nooooo, that song got stuck in my head when it came out, i found myself singing it in work.  dancing to it in clubs.  please believe me.....i swear i don t like any of their other stuff.  the fact that i own the single does not make me a girls aloud fan 5.   oasis- don t look back in anger quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot;oohh, i m sure this won t be a popular choice, but i have to be honest..i can t stand them.   don t look back in anger  is a bloody good song though, lol   i also heard they are bringing out another album...noooo  4.  mariah carrey- without you quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot;what?   that annoying little diva?  yes.....i have a problem, i can t get away with slagging her off anymore   i loved without you, the women can really sing that song   after my sister cought me screaching along to it one day i had no choice but to fess up   i now have to grit my teeth when i hear her, as one remark will have my sister telling whoever we are with at the time my dirty little secret.do i have to go on? *cringe*3.  aqua- barbie girl quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot;i loved it, how embarrasing is that?   everyone will remember this one...and the video.....oh god the video   it s just a fun song    quot;come on barbie, lets go party, ah ah oh yeah....ahem 2.  bay city rollers- bye bye baby quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot;granted, i was not around in their tartan clad glory days, however, this did not save me from my mothers music collection   i found myself tapping my feet to this song...even..gulp...singing along.  i just pray this is never played on a night out....as i just don t trust myself 1.   wham- last christmas quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot; quot;i love this song, mostly because i love christmas.  i hate all their other songs, sooo cheesy   this is number 1 because there is just no escaping it   every christmas it comes back to hunt me, played endlessly in all the bars and  lizzy, very merry after a few xmas drinks starts to sing along....very loudly  so there you go   its not that bad really...i mean, its not like i own any of their albums or anything   *cough*i have recommended the songs not the artists, lol thanks for reading

warning: contains spoilers   well what to say about one of the most anticipated films this year? at the end of  quot;the fellowship of the ring quot; the 9 main characters making up the fellowship are split into 4 groups; gandalf (ian mckellen) aparently lost in the mines, frodo and sam heading to mordor to destroy the ring, merry and pippin captured by the uruk-hai and legolas, aragorn and gimlli chasing after them.aragorn and co. are tracking the orcs when they are met by theoden s nephew and band of riders exiled from rohan. tracking merry and pippin into the woods they meet gandalf who has been sent back to middle earth as gandalf the white. merry and pippin are travelling with the ents on the way to an ent meeting. after discovering merry and pippin are safe, aragorn, legolas, gimlli and gandalf head back to rohan to help. theoden the king of rohan has been all but taken over by sauroman   s forces with the help of wormtongue, who is cast out by gandalf and the old king restored. theoden will not fight the approaching army from isenguard so together they flee to helm   s deep, a fortress in a mountain and gandalf leaves them. a long battle ensues and (with the help of some elves and the late arrival of gandalf) they defeat saurman   s army. merry and pippin attend then ent meeting i which the ents decide not to participate in the war. afterwards they discover masses of destroyed forest and treebeard is so angry he leads the ents in an attack on isenguard, in which it is destroyed. meanwhile frodo and sam have been caught up by gollum who is leading them to mordor, an ongoing fight is going on between his old self and the gollum poisoned by the ring. eventually they are all caught by faramir and his men who try to take the ring from frodo. faramir lets them go, and the film ends with gollum plotting the downfall of frodo and sam and to regain the ring.look out for some mistakes peter jackson didn   t spot: legolas    eyes are brown during some of the helm   s deep battle and the cut on merry   s forehead changes sides a few times.you cant help but be enchanted by this film; it does move away from some of the magic of the fellowship, but as with any trilogy it is hard to beat the first. bring on the 17th of december and the return of the king

thsi is the kind of fast food restuarant (i use the term very loosely) that makes you feel like a sell out if you use it.  you know what to expect from macdonalds.  tasteless burgers, the inevitable gherkin (does any one eay those?), long queues in the school holidays, and moody pubescents on either side of the counter.  if you like your food the same whereever you go, this is the place for you.  all this homogenised sanitised fodder makes me think of the stepford wives.  and wher do you think they would take their kids to eat?  what - you need to ask?

symarip s skinhead moonstomp is a nice little compilation of symarip s best songs. the all black ska and reggae band from the uk, were one keen to recognise their early and loyal followers, the skinheads and released plenty of tracks dedicated to them: skinhead moonsomp, skinhead jamboree, skinhead girl for instance.skinhead moonstomp starts off the album withi want all you skinheads to get up on your feetput your braces together and your boots on your feetand give me some of that old moonstompingand dates back to a time when black ska and white skinheads went hand in hand. this may not be the best skinhead reggae album but it s certainly a very good recording and one with plenty of hits on it, featuring lots of tracks that would later be covered by bands like the specials. the sound does sound a bit dated and basic but it s enjoyable all the same, although the album is quite long and as a lot of the tracks have the same sound, you might be ready for it to finish by the later tracks.1. skinhead moonstomp - symarip, smith, ney2. geronimo - symarip, cousins3. skinhead jamboree - symarip, naismith4. stingo - symarip, unidentified5. i m a puppet - symarip, unidentified6. to sir with love - symarip, london7. flour dumpling - symarip, unidentified8. telstar - symarip, meek, joe9. skinhead girl - symarip, smith, ney10. mosquito bite - symarip, pitter11. the fit - symarip, neysmith12. feel alright - symarip, thomas13. parson s corner - symarip, neysmith14. can t leave now - symarip, ellis15. phoenix city - symarip, alphonso16. reggae shuffle - symarip, unidentified17. there goes my heart - symarip, naismith18. all for you - symarip, ellis19. la bella jig - symarip, traditional20. bam bam baji - symarip, neysmith

this is the home system translation of the popular arcade hit. it was released  for the sega megadrive in 1994. the game proved to be a smashing success as it combined the fun of basketball and fighting games. it wasn t what you may call a basketball simulation but rather a fun smash mouth sports game. here is the roster.eastern conference atlanta hawks - dominique wilkins and stacey augmonboston celtics - dee brown and robert parishcharlotte hornets - larry johnson and alonzo mourningchicago bulls - scottie pippen and horace grantcleveland cavaliers - mark price and brad daughertydetroit pistons - isiah thomas and bill laimbeerindiana pacers - reggie miller and derrick mckeymilwaukee bucks - brad lohaus and blue edwardsmiami heat - rony seikaly and harold minernew jersey nets - derrick coleman and kenny andersonnew york knicks - patrick ewing and john starksorlando magic - nick anderson and scott skilesphiladelphia 76ers - clarence weatherspoon and jeff hornacekwashington bullets - tom gugliotta and harvey grantwestern conferencedallas mavericks - derek harper and jim jacksondenver nuggets - dikembe mutombo and laphonso ellisgolden state warriors - tim hardaway and chris mullinhouston rockets - hakeem olajuwon and vernon maxwelllos angeles clippers - danny manning and ron harperlos angeles lakers - vlade divac and james worthyminnesota timberwolves - christian laettner and chuck personphoenix suns - dan majerle and kevin johnsonportland trail blazers - clyde drexler and terry portersacramento kings - wayman tisdale and mitch richmondsan antonio spurs - david robinson and sean elliottseattle supersonics - shawn kemp and detlef schrempfutah jazz - karl malone and john stocktonthe game offers an intriguing concept. the dunks and moves defy the laws of gravity and physics. the game is also full of phrases such as boomshakalaka and he s on fire  also fouls are legal and this adds a level of violence in the game. its a cross between mortal kombat and nba live. i enjoyed playing my favorite stars such as scottie pippen, david robinson, reggie miller, shawn kemp and dominique wilkins. unfortunately players such as charles barkley, michael jordan and shaquille o  neil are not included due to legal issues.this game may pale in comparison to the sound quality and graphics of the new games. the important factor however is fun. with more than two dozen teams, there is plenty of replay value here. i recommend this to both gamers and sports fans.

transformers the movie started off with unicron devouring the planet lithone. this planet is inhabited by robots and the only survivors were kranix and his crew. the scene then shifts to the autobot moonbases where they plan to liberate cybertron from the clutches of the evil decepticons. they preparing a supply shuttle for launch to autobot city on earth. the communication however, was intercepted by laserbeak and the decepticons ended up slaughtering the autobot crew. meanwhile, back on earth, daniel and hotrod were fishing and saw the shuttle landing. they raced to meet the shuttle when it lands. hotrod however discovers that the shuttle is infested with decepticons and proceeds to blast them the decepticons then attack and lay siege to the autobot city. the autobots were badly outnumbered with a big chunk of the decpticon army ramming down their throat. they then sent a signal to optimus prime to send reinforcements. meanwhile, most of the defenses of autobot city were already breached and there were casualties. to finish off the autobots the constructicons merged into devastator and all seemed lost. optimus prime and the dinobots arrived just in time and turn the tide of battle. optimus prime singlehandedly decimated the decepticon army and it came down to a one-on-one encounter with optimus prime and megatron. optimus prime was set to win and finish off megatron but hotrod got in the way and optimus was fatally wounded. he, however, was able to strike a mortal blow and badly damaged megatron. without their leader, the decepticons hastily retreated. optimus would die soon afterward and the autobot matrix of leadership was passed on to ultra magnus. the decepticons threw the wounded decepticons including megatron overboard. the castaway decepticons were then reformed by unicron into an elite robot army and megatron became galvatron. the unicrons proceeded to crash in on starscream s coronation and obliterate starscream. galvatron then became the new decepticon leader.the decepticons proceeded to hound ultra magnus and the decepticons and destroy the matrix. they were able to capture it from ultra magnus and badly damage him in the process. after a brief tussle with the junkions, they are able to make friend with them.the junkions put ultra magnus back together and the autobots and junkions proceed to attack unicron. unicron, after an argument with galvatron, began assaulting cybertron. the combined forces of the junkions, autbots and decepticons assault unicron with little success. the autobots go inside unicron and battle through his internal defenses. hotrod discovers galvatron with the matrix on a chain in his neck. he valiantly battles galvatron. throught he battle, he is able to seize the matrix.hotrod discovers his destiny to become rodimus prime and unleashes the power of the matrix. unicron is destroyed and galvatron is hurled into deep space. the autobots then celebrate under their newfound leader.the cartoon is excellent. the knock though is the numerous animation errors. during the reformatting of the decepticons there are two cyclonuses. also there are four dinobots as opposed to five. other errors are also present. the plus is the performance of leonard  quot;mr. spock quot; nimoy as galvatron and other celebrity voicings. the story is inspiring as a lowly autobot like hotrod became a leader. he matured from a carefree individual to become a leader.

all the extras you could ever need in a dvd set. oh ...you get the movies aswel.the first three movies are simply stunning. the first two in particular are the stuff of cinema legend and need to be watched even if its just once. the term  quot;on the edge of your seat quot; must have been invented for these movies. you literally are woundering whats around the next corner and the atisipation of something making you jump is what makes these movies increadible. however the fourth move is really bad and with disasterous performances by people like wynona ryder it possibly shouldnt be watched.dont let that put you off however. even with the first three movies alone thi is worth every penny. there isnt much i can say without ruining it for those that havnt seen it, which if you havnt you should stop readig and buy it.

i wrote this piece after visiting the site of belsen concentration / extermination camp in germany.a car pulled up on the cobbled roadway next to the fence. it was a late model mercedes containing five people. the driver got out and walked round to the boot where he pulled out and unfolded a wheelchair which he pushed round to the nearside rear passenger door.the rest of the family got out, a middle aged woman and two teenaged children, and fussed around the elderly lady who was struggling to get out. quot;help me young yitzaak, i m not as young as i was, quot;yitzaak replied with a grin: quot;neither am i, great grandmother, i was seventeen last week, now i am seventeen and one week. quot;the old lady smiled at him and eased herself into the wheelchair that had been brought near. she was tired, it had been a long flight from new york, the long drive from d   sseldorf to this lonely spot on the lunenburg heath had tired her but she was glad to be here at last.her grandson who had organized the trip pushed the wheelchair up to a seemingly random spot on the ancient barbed wire fence. the cruel steel strands of two generations ago had softened to a gossamer of rust, the angled tops of the posts still bore the ceramic insulators that had carried the electrified wires which had long since disappeared. slowly and with great difficulty the old lady struggled to her feet and gripped hard on the concrete post nearest to her.she pulled five white rags from her bag and tied them to the wire then took out a small book and started to chant: quot;yitgadal veyitkadash shemey rababe olma di vera chir uteyveyamlich malchuteyve yatzmach purkaney vi ykarev meshicheybechayeychon u veyomeychonu vechayey di chol beyt yisraelba agala u vizman kariv ve imru amenyehey sh mey raba mevorach le olam u le olmey olmayayitbarach ve yishtabach ve yitpa ar ve yitromam ve yitnaseyve yithadar ve yit aleh ve yiythalalshe mey dikudsha b rich hule ela min kol birchata ve shirata tushbechata ve nechematada amiran be olma ve imru amenyehey sh lama raba min shemaya ve chayim tovimaleynu ve al kol yisrael ve imru ameno seh shalom bimromavhu ya aseh shalom aleynu ve al kol yisraelve imru amen. quot;as she came to the end of her prayer her sleeve slipped up her arm exposing parchment like skin that barely covered the bones. on the inside of her withered arm, amongst the wrinkles barely readable was a faded tattoo, a number that meant everything to one generation and nothing to another.she stood quietly for several minutes, eyes closed by the weight of her memories with tears rolling down her worn face.at last she turned and sat back down in the wheelchair. quot;i have said my goodbyes ibrahim, it s time to go home now. quot; quot;ok grandmother, let me settle you back in the car. quot;the family climbed back into the car and they swept away in a flurry of early fallen autumn leaves.the fence returned to its lonely vigil of the sour-grassed mounds that hid the remains of countless lives, memories and loves. night fell and silence bore the only witness to history.

why i chose  this story  lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;when most people think of doctor who i am sure the first thing that pops into there heads is the doctors brilliant enemy the mighty daleks and to be truthful this was the first thing that attracted me to this story because i love everything about them, forget the cylons from battle star galactica and the borg from startrek the daleks were and always will never truly be destroyed what ever happens in the stories.this is also said to be one of the best storeys from the colin baker years and no matter what people say about colin baker being the worst doctor ever ,this story shows that the only reason he was said to be the poor doctor was because the stories don t use him to full effect .the price of this story also pushed me to look at it to as it was on special offer.a little look at the story in brief lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;the story start with the doctor and his assistant peri who are both well covered up as the planet is covered in snow in this region ,the planet of necro is a funeral home for the galaxys elite and also a place for people to be put in suspended animation,it isn t long before the doctor is attacked my a mutant creature which was once human until a person known as the great healer experimented on him,when the doctor is in the funeral home that s when the plans of both the healer and other sides all come together,,i don t want to go into the story much put lets just say there is a twist to everything .the story also deals with many different issue like greed ,jealousy and the need for loyalty and respect.what s included on the dvd lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;commentary by nicola bryant (peri), terry molloy (davros),eric saward (writer) graeme harper (director)revelation exhumed cast and crew in a look back at the making of the story.cgi effects the option to watch this story with some of the original effects replaced with new cgi versionsdeleted scenes three short scenes not used in the finished storyoptional dolby digital 5.1 surround a mix of sound created especially for the dvd versionphoto gallerybits you may want to know lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;aspect ratio = 4.3main sound-track = english,dolby digital 5.1disc format = dvd9feature length = 89 mins approxregion = 2+4 colour pal uksubtitles = english for hard of hearingrated pgwhat i thought of the story lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;i think this story is one the best i have seen of the older doctors and the story is filled with lots of humour that s all in the right places,the story not only shows the doctors story but the grave robbers story as well and davros s and the assassins ,when you look back on this episode you really can tell allot of time and effort was put into the sets as well and the story and special effects and the strangest thing i noticed was davros s chair is hovering at one point and you can see the thrusters under his chair and this was all before the dalek in the following years story could hover?this story also makes me question the bbc as well colin baker was kicked out of the role of the doctor after just one year is really is crazy .there is also lots of well know british actors in this story to but i am not going to let you know who they are as that would be spoiling the story,if you like a story with a bite of bite to it then grab this one as it was well worth the money i bayed for itinformation you may want to know lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;this story is the first one i know of that davros fires electricity out of his hand and 3rd eye in the centre of his head,davros s new imperial daleks have been created from humans that were suspended in animation as well as that the mutant bodies of these new daleks are incubated in a clear dalek shell which looks to like its made from a clear plastic,also daleks will kill a rival daleks faction (eg imperial and renegade) as they both see one another as inferior

1991/92 welcomed a return on nbc for this great show about nothing. the writer larry david had to hire extra help on this season beacuse nbc wanted 22 episodes, larry and jerry could feel the change from the first two series that the public was really taking to the show. this welcomed a return from all of the regulars from the first two seasons, jerry seinfeld (of course), jason alexander, (george costansa) michael richards, (kosmo kramer) and julia louis dreyfus.(elaine bennis) each one of them was very happy everything was working out and they could all have a pay rise too   jason alexander who plays george costansa wanted more storylines for his character because he didn t think that george really had a great precense in the first two seasons. larry and jerry agreed to this as jerry would always write the other cast their lines before he put himself in.they have made some marvelous episodes in this season and my personal favourites are  quot;the limo quot; when all of the characters get caught up in a nazi rally, who can forget  quot;the garage quot; where kramer parks his car somewhere and it takes them all of the episode to find it  there are so many good episodes here that you will want to watch them over and over again, these are as funny as the first time you watch them.the episodes on this series are :1. the note2. the truth3. the dog4. the library5. the pen6. the parking garage7. the cafe8. the tape9. the nose job10. the alternate side11. the red dot12. the suicide13. the subway14. the pez despenser15. the boyfriend (part 1)16. the boyfriend (part 2)17. the fix up18. the limo19. the good samaritan20. the letter21. the parking space22. the keysin this series each of the characters had their own storylines evolving around them such as  quot;the nose job quot; this was a george story about his new girlfriend who had a very big nose.  quot;the parking garage quot; was really kramers who went to the mall to buy an air conditioner.there are so many good episodes and things to mention on this third series that it could take hours to list all of it s good points.this third series was also far superior to the first and second series, with better character performances and better storylines.also on this package are a lot of extras that include :kramer versus kramer, this shows you where jerry got the name kramer from....notes about nothing, behind the scenes scoops and production notesinside looks, cast and crew interviewsin the vault, deleted scenesmaster of his domain, jerry s stand up routinesnbc advertsyada, yada, yada, creator and cast commentriesand much, much more

this challenge was set by one of my buddies snowiestelf so you have him to thank for the  fascinating  facts you are about to read.  please note names have been changed to protect the guilty  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;what is your age lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;i turned thirty eight two weeks ago.  i usually only feel twenty eight, apart from the times when my one year old wakes me up at 4.00 am wanting to play   on those occasions, i feel a hell of a lot older  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;in which month is your birthday? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;my birthday is in january.  my friends used to say having a birthday so close to christmas was a bit of a nuisance because people would give you one present which covered both.  i never really came across this, apart from one occasion when i turned 18 and my mum and dad gave me the money to buy my first car.  it was a y reg datsun cherry and it went on for years and years.  it was dark metallic blue with an orange  go faster  stripe all the way round the side.  god i was cool     ah, happy days  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;in who can you always confide? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;my dogs because they look at me intently, always listen (especially if a say bickies), never answer me back, and when they wag their tales, i know everything is going to be alright.  seriously though, i would have to say my husband.  he is always very supportive and usually comes up with a good idea if i am unsure what to do about something.   gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;how many times did you ever get detention at school? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;i only got it once and that was a sort of joint detention with the whole class.  somebody threw something across the classroom and the teacher asked whoever it was to own up, otherwise the whole class would be kept back after school.  alas, nobody owned up so we all had to stay behind and write lines saying that we were not to throw things in the classroom.  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;do you have a big ego? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;no, not at all.  never have had.  and i can t stand people who have big egos either.  they irritate me and i always feel like telling them a few home truths.  my husband s friend is a prime example.  brag brag brag, in his mind, he s done this, he s done that.  he s got a flash sports car.  all the women like him.  reality check:  he s hardly done a thing apart from hold a bar up.  the sports car with the personalised number plate is hardly big enough to get his big toe, let alone his big head, and as for the women - i understand from my husband that it is they who give the old heave-ho after finding out there is too much competition for the bathroom mirror   (can you tell i don t like him?)  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;do you like fish? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;in what capacity?  as a pet or as a food.  well, yes to both really.  i love fish, especially salmon and haddock (not at the same time ).  as for the pets, i have always kept a coldwater aquarium with shubunkins and/or fantails.  i no longer have that but have just set up a 4  tropical tank. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;did you do well in your gcse s (o levels) lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;not too bad. i took my exams just before the gcse s came into force so it was all o level and cse.  so here we go:english language o level english literature cse2maths cse3geography cse2biology cse2home economics cse2typing cse2typing pitman advancedaudio typing rsa1btec diploma in business studiesah, that s my cv out of the way   must remember to update that soon.   gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;what would make you really happy right now? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;to hear that all cruelty to children and animals has been stopped.  on a more realistic and materialistic note, a win on the lottery would be good.  i m not greedy -    1 million will do.   gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;do you prefer your drinks with or without ice? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;with.  especially fizzy drinks - the bubbles seem sharper   hmm, how sad am i.   gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;if you had a jukebox right now, what would you put on? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;ah, this is an easy one.  hotel california by the eagles.  my all time favourite band (as anyone who has read my earlier reviews will know). don henley has one of the best voices in the business.  it s one of those songs that i can t help singing along to and has that  feelgood factor .   gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;describe your kitchen  lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;in total need of decoration and replastering   (are you listening dear husband?) will that do?  ok, most importantly, it s quite a good size.  a nice big fridge/freezer, the usual appliances on the worktops including a steriliser which i hope i can put away shortly once my son is off the bottles.  a very large dog basket in the corner (which has to cater for two very large labradors). now the window sill usually raises a few eyebrows.  sat neatly on this are three home-brew barrels.  but these are not used for what they are intended.  as i mentioned earlier, i have a tropical fish tank.  so does my husband (only his is smaller than mine, as i like to keep reminding him )  we use these barrels for siphoning the water for the tanks from an ro filter so that the fish get the purest water possible.  so we have one barrel each, and then the third is for siphoning the dirty water from the tanks.  bet you re sorry you asked now   other than that, nothing too out of the ordinary in the kitchen.   gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;love or lust? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;definitely love.  it lasts longer  with love you get all the other bits such as changing your tyre for you, driving you for a night out with your mates and picking you up again, and best of all - being your best mate  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;do you have manners? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;definitely.  and it really annoys me when i meet people who don t know the meaning of please and thank you and just general courtesy.   gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;would you ever go to a nudist beach lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;hell no   unless i could go and hide somewhere just to have a laugh at some of the other people who go there.  from what i have seen on tv, they are usually full of old fat people who haven t seen there, erm, feet in years  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;do you like opera lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;no, it s not really my thing.  i can never understand what they are singing.  and more importantly, you can t really get on your feet and start boogying    gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;if you could meet any person (alive or dead), who would it be? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;there are two really.  with regard to a real live person, it would have to be don henley.  this man has such talent and a voice to die for.i would also love to meet james dean just to see if he was really as cracked up as people say he was.   gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;what is your favourite quote?

lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;most of them really.  broccoli is nice and i quite like broad beans.  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;how much is in your wardrobe? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;too much.  i have two wardrobes (greedy, i know) because when i was still working before i left to have my son, i needed clothes for the office, but i liked to keep these separate from my normal day to day clothes as this is mainly old jeans, trousers baggy tops and scruffy boots which i keep for walking the dogs. i really need a sort out  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;do you like xmas? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;i love it, especially now i have a baby.  it makes christmas all the more appealing if you can watch a little person opening all his presents and getting so excited - yes, so excited that he spends all day playing with the paper  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;what did you eat yesterday?

 ah, right, i remember. for breakfast, i had a bowl of porridge, toast and a mug of tea.  lunch comprised a tin of heinz chicken soup and a load of biscuits.  and then for dinner, i had scampi, boiled new potatoes, peas and carrots and then a extra fruit thick   creamy blueberry yoghurt.     gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;what is your favourite animal at the zoo?

(please note: i originally posted this opinion on the ciao cafe, as the product for the two towers was not available). i ve contacted ciao and my origingal op is going to be deleted.the lord of the rings     the two towerscouldn   t wait for this film to come out, so i went to an advanced screening on wednesday 18th december.the film opens up with various mountain scenery (presumably the misty mountains), and then we are drawn to an area of the mountains. when you start to get closer, we hear voices and they grow louder as we get nearer. the voices are of that of gandalf, frodo and the rest of the fellowship, crossing the bridge of kazad-dum.gandalf is the last to cross, and if you   ve seen the 1st instalment    the fellowship of the ring    you   ll know that he battles the balrog of morgoth. as the balrog falls into the void of kazad-dum, he attacks gandalf and he falls just clinging onto the bridge. gandalf lets go and falls into kazad-dum. as we see gandalf fall, he grabs his sword and begins to attack the falling balrog, then eventually we see both gandalf and the balrog fighting from the caverns of kazad-dum, right to the snow-peaked tops of the misty mountains.we then go to the journey of frodo and sam to take the ring to mount doom in mordor. the two hobbits keep round in circles, as they don   t know the territory. then an unusual being is seen creeping towards them as they are sleeping. it   s gollum (the cgi department has done a top-notch job of making a complete cgi character. andy circus is the voice of gollum). as the film progresses with this specific part of the story. i couldn   t help but feel sorry for gollum and how the ring drove him mad. the ring starts to take over frodo, making him attack his friend, falling into the dead marshes (as the ring starts to get heavier as they get closer to mordor,) and signalling the nazgul.at the end of the 1st film, merry and pippin were captured by the uruk-hai and orcs sent by saruman to get the ring. as they are travelling on their way back to isengard. the uruk-hai and orcs start to fight amongst themselves. as the orcs want to have hobbit for lunch. as the fight continues, a cavalry of horsemen attack both orcs and uruks, killing all that were there. merry and pippin crawl into the (fanghorn) forest for safety. they climb up a tree for safety, one of the orcs escaped and attacks them. but the tree wakes up and kills the orc. the tree is actually alive and is an ent called treebeard (voiced by john rhys-davies). treebeard and the ents are the oldest living creatures in middle earth.the above 2 stories are in my opinion the sub-stories of the film. the next story of the film is what i think the film is mainly focused on, is the journey of aragorn, legolas and gimli to the country of rohan. of how it   s borders are being attacked by both isengard and mordor. as aragorn, legolas and gimli track the uruks they are met by the riders of rohan. who say that they killed a band of uruks and orcs the previous night. and tell them that their remains are a few miles ahead. aragorn tracks that the hobbits survived as they went into the forest. while in the forest they see a wizard clothed all in white. they attack thinking it   s sauruman. the wizard shows himself as gandalf. not as gandalf the grey, but now as gandalf the white.they ride off to edoras (the capital city of rohan) to see their king, theoden. he   s old and withered. his sneaky advisor wormtongue (brad douriff) is secretly a spy of sauruman, who has put a spell on the king. gandalf releases the king from saurumans spell and wormtongue is banished. theoden orders the city to be evacuated and the people go to the fortress of helms deep for safety. sauruman sends all his uruk-hai army to kill everyone there. (the battle for helm   s deep is just outstanding). during the battle gimli and legolas strike up an unusual friendship.i can   t really write anymore without spoiling the story. (if i   ve done that already, well i   m sorry  ) and in all honesty, there was that much happening in the film, you kind of forget. but i   ll tell you, you   ve got to go to the cinema to see this. it   s better than    the fellowship of the ring   . the scenery, the characters. peter jackson has done a brilliant job of directing these films. to me he sticks with the flow of prof. tolkeins books. (it gets all exciting, dies down a bit and builds up to the next exciting chapter. if anyone has read the books, i think that they would agree with me on that). i think j.r.r. tolkien would be proud of the 2 films made. and hopefully the 3rd film as well (the amount of story that the 3rd film will have to cover is unreal, if jackson pulls it off we have one hell of a trillogy. although we have another year to wait for that one    ). anyhow my real praise goes to the costume department in this film. the elven battle armour is just wow. and if they don   t get an oscar in 2003 the academy needs a good kick up the bum   cast of characters:galdalf - sir ian mckellanfrodo baggins - elija woodsgollum/smeagol     andy circus saurmon - christopher leesam gamgee - sean astinarwen - liv tylergaladriel - cate blanchetgimli/treebeard - john ryhs daviespippin - billy boydlegolas - orlando bloomstrider/aragorn - viggo mortensen merry - domonic monaghanlord elrond     hugo weavingright that   s it, go and see lord of the rings     the two towers. you won   t regret it.

well i   ve been trying to decide on how in the world am i going to write an opinion on this masterpiece    the lord of the rings - the fellowship of the ring   . so here goes...the film opens with the background story of how the rings of power came to be, forged by the dark lord sauron, some 3000+ years ago, and how he was defeated by the last alliance of men and elves, and how isildur cut the ring from saurons hand. then the ringbetrayed isildur and passing onto gollum, then was found by bilbo baggins (if you want to know about how he found the ring of power, read    the hobbit   ).we then get transported to the beautiful countryside that introduces us to the home of the hobbits,    the shire    and introduces us to the frodo (elija woods) and gandalf (sir ian mckellen) who is driving his cart down the road to get to bilbos house. (the casting people have done an excellent job in casting the actors to their characters also the costumedept. they have done another brilliant job by making our characters even more believable, my hats off to them  the special effects are outstanding. my personal favourite, is when gandalf battles the balrog, that was just awesome.this film has been excellently directed by peter jackson as it goes in the same tempo as the books, something major happens then the slow build up to something else as jrr tolkien probably intended the story to go  )anyway, galdalf arrives at bilbo   s hobbit hole and knocks on the door, we meet bilbo (ian holm) and how he plans to leave the shire and throws his 111th birthday party as a diversion. (the firework display special effects are just outstanding, especially the dragon swooping down on all the attendees). anyway bilbo says goodbye to everyone and slips on the ring and dissapears.if i did a full opinion of the film, i   d be here till next christmas when    the two towers    is released who-hooooooo and i   d just spoil it for the people who haven   t seen this film yet. here   s a list of the characters anyway..galdalf   - sir ian mckellanfrodo baggins  - elija woodsbilbo baggins  - ian holmsaurmon          - christopher leesam gamgee  - sean astinarwen   - liv tylergaladriel  - cate blanchetgimli   - john ryhs daviesboromir          - sean beanpippin   - billy boydlegolas          - orlando bloomstrider/aragorn         - viggo mortensen merry   - domonic monaghanhugo weaving         - lord elrondmarrtin csokas  - celebornthis film in a word is just brilliant   roll on christmas 2002, so we can enjoy the next installment of this masterpiece trillogy

title: the satanic bibleauthor: anton z. lavaenon-fictionpublisher: avon booksformat: paperback66 pages1969     anton zandor lavaethe book called the satanic bible (aka. the black book), is written three years after the church of satan is established by its founder anton zandor lavae (1930-1997), and have never seen its light of  day for publication until another three years after by 1973     and ever since from this point on, the book have often gathered mainly a lot of readers, who are much likely levelling among those on the crowd of the wrong audiences. why this is so, is because that mainly its readers are those of the merely curious, the scoffing prejudiced, and/or those who think that they could gain something from the book which level on the cheesy, the bizarre, and the perverted --    sickos    whom anton lavae would term in referring to as the    losers   , whom he often attempted to dodge and avoid in associating with in his lifelong profession as the infamous founder of the satanist movement, rather than those who are clear minded enough to decipher the very essence that the book may have to offer of its substance. primarily the    book of satan    is written as a means for mockery to the christian   s bible     as the church that lavae founded known simply by the name the church of satan     intended to parody the christian church itself right from the start.it seemed apparent that the primary motive of lavae is to set a new form of ideology into the stream of humanity for the most part, an ideology defying the commonly known norm of accepted moral standards. the book however is not a bunch of mumbo-jumbo and those of what could be commonly conceptualized whenever the mention of demons, monsters, and the devil is heard, but the book rather have dabbled more on the side of the philosophical, and mainly siding on the practicality and the common sense of things which is the credo for what the church of satan actually stands for.    the book contains certain items which pertains to this reversal mockery of sorts to the holy writ, inciting such contents like the nine satanic statements, and the main book  portions which are composed of the sections: fire, air, earth, and water that consist of the main elements which are well associated with the practice of the occult.  gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; gt; lt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt; gt; lt;the book is divided in the following sections =fire:book of satan-the infernal diatribe 27a section of verses comprised of five short chapter sections, quite similar to the biblical format like those of proverbs or lamentations. containing the statements that reason out satanism in the way anton lavae have conceptualized them.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------air:book of lucifer-the enlightenment 37consists of twelve sections which includes the statements regarding the falsehood of the christian god, satanic sex, the vampire life style, human sacrifice, religious holidays, and the black mass. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------earth:book of belialthe mastery of the earth  whilst the former section could refer to a mixture of the concepts of    satanism    and (if you could consider it as such)    theology   , this part of the book composed of five chapter sub-sections     are basically referring to the outlines with regards to satanic rituals and the occult practice; so much so like a manual indeed, the basic tenets of the satanist   s creed, all in the manner of satan worship.the term belial as tagged in the title for this portion is the hebrew form for baal the bull god, worshipped by the ancient nomadic religions from the ancient past; and according to certain records are the god(s) which originated from mesopotamia     even tracing it all the way back to the age of nimrod. certain documents are found that archeological findings found relics that pertain to this papal bull god in the ancient town of nineveh, amongst other gods and idols, pertaining to what was also recorded in the bible. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------water:book of leviathan-the raging sea  with          pictures of the satanic bible - anton lavey

the calmac (caledonian mcbrayne) ferry creeps out of ullapool into the stormy swell of the minch and, green already, you wonder what you re letting yourself in for.crashing solidly into the stornoway pier at maybe the third attempt, you peer through the darkening evening and the dreich grey drizzle that only the west of scotland knows how to produce.you huddle into your rented cottage, throwing another kindly-provided peat on the open fire, and wonder what on earth possessed you to book a holiday in the western isles.but tomorrow s another day. a day of crystal clear oceans and pristine beaches. of the whitest sands in the universe and views to the end of the atlantic. smells of fresh hay, cut by scythe, draped over derelict fences to dry. crofts from another age, and standing stones from another age still. the grazing lands of lewis giving way to the moonscape that is harris. and a welcome you ll never forget.you ve got to go there, and you ll want to be a poet.

my favourite cereal has to be kellogs cornflakes as they are really nice and tasty.they come in 3 different size boxes. the one that we have is the 500g, which is quite a big box.you have cornflakes with milk. you can also add sugar as well, which i do but my husband doesn t. i think they taste even better with sugar on them.you can always recognise kellogs cornflakes with the green and red cock/hen on the front of the box.ingrediants in these cornflakes are:-thiamin which is for energy and carbohydratesriboflavin which is for healthy skin, eyes and nailsniacin which is for energyvitamin b6 which is for healthy blood, skin and nervesfolic acid which is for growing cells and healthy bloodvitamin b12 which helps blood cells grown and developiron is for oxygen.other ingrediants are maize, sugar, salt and malt flavouring.so as you can see from the above, cornflakes are good for you, apart from all the sugar that i put on to them (lol).you can buy kellogs cornflakes from supermarkets and from your local shop. i bought this box from tesco and it cost me about    1.49 i think. you can get a smaller box for about 99p.i d recommend anyone to have cornflakes for there breakfast as they are tasty

now is the time of the creatures from hell,emerging from darkness. for, blinded by light,they never can wake, as those creatures that dwellin the land of the living and promise of light.and their dreams are all nightmares,and nightmares they share,in which screams echo soundless, and no-one is there.this is the hour of the coming of deathfor those who have waited for dawning sunrise.they never will wake now, and, cheated of breath,the realisation leaves scars in their eyes.and their dreams die within them,and soundless they scream.but no-one is listening,for life is the dream.now is the time for the creatures who wait,ominous predators, stealthy to stealsouls from those lost in the mists of their fate,wounded in life. but the wounds never healand their pain overtakes them.and way overheadflies the cloud bird of darknessthat heralds the dead.***

enya is musically not to everyones taste. however, she is to mine. her music is soothing, relaxing, and enjoyable. this latest  album of her is again to her usual standards, and if you like her type of music you ll love this. my favourite still has to be orinocho flow, although others come a close second. this album include the title track, wild child, the first of autumn  and eleven others. this album is ideal for relaxing in a bath with the candles burning, and getting rid of the stress of the day/week/year  the slowness, methodical, strums just seem to unwind you.

slade and t. rex led the glam rock revolution, but sweet were hot on their heels.  this compilation is the perfect reminder of why they were so popular (except with disbelieving critics), and the music hasn t dated a bit.  the first four singles, notably  quot;funny funny quot; and  quot;co-co quot;, may have been more bubblegum and less representative, but with  quot;little willy quot; they hit their stomping stride, and in  quot;blockbuster quot;,  quot;hell raiser quot; and  quot;teenage rampage quot; they achieved that masterful combination of great danceable pop and sheer driving rock energy.after cutting free from chinn and chapman to write and produce their own material,  quot;fox on the run quot; and  quot;action quot; (covered almost not for note by def leppard some years later) proved they could stand on their own.  the late 70s weren t so kind to them, with only one more top 10 entry, the slower  quot;love is like oxygen quot;, but unless you re a real sweet fanatic, you re in for a treat when you hear less successful singles like  quot;stairway to the stars quot;,  quot;lost angels quot;,  quot;fever of love quot; and the very catchy  quot;sixites man quot; (recorded after the departure of the late great brian connolly) for the first time.if you ve ever caught the current reincarnation of the band led by their original lead guitarist, andy scott, live on stage, you ll know why us over-30s still adore the band (and you ve probably got this album already).  if not, treat yourself to this today

i will say now that this opinion does not discuss building your pc as is perhaps should given the category, but it discusses building your own webpage using html.once you know it, html is easy, but newcomers to web design will need to learn about html and how it works. here are the basics (you will notice words are spelt the american way such as color and center):  lt;html gt; put this at the start of your html and put  lt;/html gt; (end html) at the end. ************************************  lt;head gt; this includes the title of your page and sometimes a few other bits of information. put  lt;head gt; after  lt;html gt;. after you have put  lt;head gt;, to add a title of the page (appears at top of browser window) put:  lt;title gt;the title of the page lt;/title gt; after you have finished with the head section put  lt;/head gt; for example, if you wanted to do a page titled  my photos , put this code in:  lt;html gt;  lt;head gt;  lt;title gt;my photos lt;/title gt;  lt;/head gt;  lt;/html gt; ************************************  lt;body gt; this includes several bits of information about your page. as with html and head, start with  lt;body gt; and end with  lt;/body gt; in the body section you can put the background for your page. if it is just a colour, eg black, put  lt;body bgcolor=black gt; if it is an image, put  lt;body background= quot;web address of the pic quot; gt; body can also be used to determine the colour of the links on the page. link means a normal link, vlink means an already visited link, and alink means an active link.  lt;body link= quot;blue quot; vlink= quot;purple quot; alink= quot;red quot; gt; example, if you want a page with the title  my photos  with a red background and links stay blue all the time:  lt;html gt;  lt;head gt;  lt;title gt;my photos lt;/title gt;  lt;/head gt;  lt;body bgcolor= quot;red quot; link= quot;blue quot; vlink= quot;blue quot; alink= quot;blue quot; gt;  lt;/body gt;  lt;/html gt; you don t actually usually need to use the html, head and body tags, if you don t use them the settings will be default (where the title is just the web address, the background is plain white and links are blue). ************************************  lt;font gt; this is used to change the details about the text you are about to use. the default (if you don t write anything about the font) is plain black text in times new roman font. in the font tag you can adjust the colour of the text, you may want to make it green:  lt;font color=green gt; you can also change the size of the font:  lt;font size= quot;5 quot; gt; you can change the actual font style too:  lt;font face= quot;arial quot; gt; extras not included in the font tag are bold, italic, underlined and strike-thru writing. for bold just put this:  lt;b gt;the text you want in bold lt;/b gt; for underlined text put:  lt;u gt; the text you want underlined lt;/u gt; also do the same for:  lt;i gt; italic and  lt;s gt; strike-thru example, if you want a page with a title  my photos  and with a red background, links in blue, and bold green text saying  picture of me   lt;html gt;  lt;head gt;  lt;title gt;my photos lt;/title gt;  lt;/head gt;  lt;body bgcolor= quot;red quot; link= quot;blue quot; vlink= quot;blue quot; alink= quot;blue quot; gt;  lt;/body gt;  lt;font color= quot;green quot; gt; lt;b gt;picture of me lt;/b gt;  lt;/html gt; ************************************ you can align text to the centre of the screen too.  lt;center gt; puts following text in the centre of the screen, this can be ended with  lt;/center gt; ************************************ to miss a line type  lt;br gt; to miss two lines type  lt;p gt; or  lt;br gt; lt;br gt; for a line across the page type  lt;hr gt; these can be in different colours and sizes,  lt;hr color= quot;red quot; width=100 gt; ************************************  lt;img gt; short for image. use this tag for any images you wish to insert on your page. include the web address of the image to be put on the page (src stands for source):  lt;img src= quot;http://images-uk.ciao.com/images/header2/ciao_logo.gif quot; gt; if the image is in the same folder as the page, you can shorten this code. say, for example, the image address was  quot;http://www.ciao.com/dog.gif quot;, if the page is also in the main ciao folder you can simply type  lt;img src= quot;dog.gif quot; gt; also with images you can determine the size. to find the default size, right-click on a picture and click on properties.  lt;img src= quot;dog.gif quot; width= quot;100 quot; height= quot;100 quot; gt; example, if you want a page titled  my photos  with a red background, links all in blue, bold green text saying picture of me and a centered image of the ciao logo:  lt;html gt;  lt;head gt;  lt;title gt;my photos lt;/title gt;  lt;/head gt;  lt;body bgcolor= quot;red quot; link= quot;blue quot; vlink= quot;blue quot; alink= quot;blue quot; gt;  lt;/body gt;  lt;font color= quot;green quot; gt; lt;b gt;picture of me lt;/b gt;  lt;p gt;  lt;center gt;  lt;img src= quot;http://images-uk.ciao.com/images/header2/ciao_logo.gif quot; gt;  lt;/center gt;  lt;/html gt; ***********************************  lt;ul gt; for bullet points. you use  lt;ul gt; to start a bulleted list and  lt;/ul gt; to end a bulleted list. for each point put  lt;li gt;, for example: for christmas i want:-  lt;ul gt;  lt;li gt;computer game  lt;li gt;football shirt  lt;li gt;cd  lt;li gt;chocolates   lt;/ul gt; example, if you want a page titled  my photos  with a red background, links all in blue, bold green text saying picture of me and a centered image of the ciao logo, followed by a bulleted list saying one two and three:  lt;html gt;  lt;head gt;  lt;title gt;my photos lt;/title gt;  lt;/head gt;  lt;body bgcolor= quot;red quot; link= quot;blue quot; vlink= quot;blue quot; alink= quot;blue quot; gt;  lt;/body gt;  lt;font color= quot;green quot; gt; lt;b gt;picture of me lt;/b gt;  lt;p gt;  lt;center gt;  lt;img src= quot;http://images-uk.ciao.com/images/header2/ciao_logo.gif quot; gt;  lt;/center gt;  lt;ul gt;  lt;li gt;one  lt;li gt;two  lt;li gt;three  lt;/ul gt;  lt;/html gt; ***********************************  lt;a gt; this is used for links:  lt;a gt;click here lt;/a gt; you need to put the web address of the page or file you are linking to. for this href is used:  lt;a href= quot;http://www.ciao.com quot; gt;click here for ciao lt;/a gt; you can also use images as links, say you wanted the ciao logo as a link to ciao, you just put the image where you normally put text:  lt;a href= quot;http://www.ciao.com quot; gt;  lt;img src= quot;http://images-uk.ciao.com/images/header2/ciao_logo.gif quot; gt;  lt;/a gt; example, if you want a page titled  my photos  with a red background, links all in blue, bold green text saying picture of me and a centered image of the ciao logo, followed by a bulleted list saying one two and three, but this time our ciao logo will link to the ciao site:  lt;html gt;  lt;head gt;  lt;title gt;my photos lt;/title gt;  lt;/head gt;  lt;body bgcolor= quot;red quot; link= quot;blue quot; vlink= quot;blue quot; alink= quot;blue quot; gt;  lt;/body gt;  lt;font color= quot;green quot; gt; lt;b gt;picture of me lt;/b gt;  lt;p gt;  lt;center gt;  lt;a href= quot;http://www.ciao.com quot; gt;  lt;img src= quot;http://images-uk.ciao.com/images/header2/ciao_logo.gif quot; gt;  lt;/a gt;  lt;/center gt;  lt;ul gt;  lt;li gt;one  lt;li gt;two  lt;li gt;three  lt;/ul gt;  lt;/html gt; *********************************** so those are the basics of html. you can also use html for forms, tables, frames and much more. for any questions about these other website features or html in general, please email me on danwilkie777@hotmail.com  thanks

the follow-up to alisha s attic debut album  quot;alisha rules the world quot; performed disappointingly in the charts.  although the first single  quot;the incidentals quot; was a top 20 hit, the other two releases,  quot;wish i were you quot; and  quot;barbarella quot; only just made the top 40.i loved the first album and was hoping for more of the same from the follow-up.  the sound is more polished and perhaps lacks the spontaneity of the first album.  the vocal performances are strong and the sisters are at their best on some of the songs they produced themselves such as  quot;karmically close quot;.at 15 tracks long  quot;illumina quot; could have done with having 2/3 songs removed - quantity does not equal quality.  there are still plenty of gems on the album such as the cheeky  quot;going down quot;, dramatic  quot;dive in quot; and strange  quot;me and the dolphins quot;.overall i would say that if you enjoyed  quot;alisha rules the world quot; you will like  quot;illumina quot; - simple pop songs with catchy harmonies.

this is a little something i have picked up from the weekend papers - something that made me stop and think.  i would like to share this story with the ciao community.  it is not what i normally post, but i hope that a few of you out there might appreciate reading it as much as i did.if you could imagine the entire world population shrunk down to a village of just 100 people, with all existing human ratios remaining the same, what would we have?  there would be:57 asians21 europeans14 from the americas8 africans52 would be female48 would be male70 would be non-white30 would be white70 would be non-christian30 would be christian89 would be heterosexual11 would be homosexual6 of the people would possess 59  of the village s wealth, and all six would be from the united states80 would be living in sub-standard housing70 would be unable to read50 would suffer from malnutrition1 would be near death1 would be near birth1 (yes, only 1) would have had a college education1 would own a computerso, if you have food in the kitchen, clothes on your back, shelter and somewhere to sleep you are richer than 75  of the world s population.  if you have money in the bank and some spare change, you are in the top 8  of the world s wealthiest people.  and if you can read this, then you are luckier than the 2 billion people in the world who cannot read at all.makes you think, doesn t it?

this is without a doubt one of my alltime favourite movies.all the cast give superb performances,and it goes without saying that sean connery totally deserved his oscar for his performance as sgt mallone. the storyline and direction is tight and the cinematograghy equally superb in capturing the period and violence of the prohibition years.kevin costner gives one of his most memorable performances as fbi crimebuster elliot ness.anyone who loves movies must see this if they get the chance.it is simply a brilliant movie that when you have seen it you will never forget.

i bought this prduct beacause of all the hype that surrounds nokia phones. however since purchasing my nokia 3310, new phones such as the seimans c35i and sony j5 have appeared on the market and im my oppinion the are both alot better than the 3310. the sony j5 is awesome, with great sounds, games and much more capability than my nokia 3310. ths sony j5 is smaller lighter and battery life is alot better then that of the 3310. on the practical side the 3310 is ok, but the tones and games arnt really as good as those on the sony j5. also the sounds on the nokia 3310 are just beeps the sony j5 uses real sound and has a better speaker. im not happy with my 3310 i wish i had a sony j5.

quot;queen of the damned quot; is the third installment of the vampire chronicles. in this novel, we are treated to a solution of the cliffhanger ending of  quot;the vampire lestat quot; and a overall view of that book; by this i mean that much of this novel retells the events of  quot;the vampire lestat quot; again, but through different angles. all the characters we have come to love are mentioned and focused on individually and we get their sense of what happens, not just lestat s, which is very refreshing. in this installment, rice has chosen to write in the third person, and for me, this is what makes this novel outstanding and probably my favourite of the lot. i like the fact that she manages to convey all the emotion we expect from these characters from a detatched position. i find this enjoyable and very interesting. i m not going to ruin the plot line for you, i truly believe that if you ve taken the time to read this then:1) you re either friend or family, in which case  quot;hi   quot; :)2) you ve already read the chronicles and are looking to see what others thought, or3) you will read them, just to see what the fuss is about  so there       read em if you haven t coz you ve missed out on a whole new world

i m hooked on this show, which you ll find ahead of richard and judy (what a combination) on itv, weekday mornings. trisha is a godess, more mumsy than ricki lake, less offensive than jerry springer, more intelligent than vanessa and consequently the queen of the daytime confessional tv. she tends to go for the genuinely messed up rather than the freaks and make a credible attempt at sorting them out, so you don t get the uncomfy voyerurism that is inevitable with springer, nor the conveyor belt mentality of ricki. her soothing tones are a joy when you re waking up and she ll leave you feeling cosy and perfectly primed for the top telly double act of richard and judy. superb.

as the title of this cd would suggest, it s devoted to music from cult films.  clearly a homage of the tarantino way of doing things, right down to the name of the cd, this contains mainly groovy 70 s numbers.before i get started on the analysis of the cd, here s the track listing:1:  little green bag - from reservoir dogs - george baker selection2:  misirlou - from pulp fiction - dick dale and his del tones3:  theme from  quot;mision: impossible quot; - from mission: impossible ( ) - lalo schifrin4:  main theme from  quot;shaft quot; - from shaft ( ) - isaac hayes5:  jungle boogie - from pulp fiction - kool   the gang6:  main theme from  quot;the man from u.n.c.l.e quot;7:  everybody s talkin  - from midnight cowboy - nilsson8:  stuck in the middle - from reservoir dogs - stealers wheel9:  blue velvet - from blue velvet - bobby vinton10: main theme from  quot; a touch of evil quot; - from a touch of evil ( ) - henry mancini11: we have all the time in the world - from on her majesty s secret service - louis armstrong12: theme from  quot;james bond quot; - from the james bond films ( ) - john barry13: main theme from  quot;joe 90 quot; - from joe 90 ( ) - barry gray orchestra14: the harder they come - from the harder they come - jimmy cliff15: here comes the hotstepper - from pret a porter - ini kamoze16: guaglione - from the guiness adverts - perez  quot;prez quot; prado17: play dead - from the young americans - bjork and david arnold18: main theme from  quot;the avengers quot; - from the avengers ( ) - laurie johnson orchestra19: you never can tell - from pulp fiction - chuck berry20: main theme from rumble - from pulp fiction - link wray21: main theme from  quot;the saint quot;22: main theme from  quot;hawaii 5-0 quot; - from hawaii 5-0 ( ) - the ventures23: main theme from  quot;the streets of san francisco quot;24: main theme from  quot;the long good friday quot; - from  quot;the long goog friday quot; - francis monkman25: theme from  quot;the sweeney quot;26: main theme from  quot;dangerman quot; - from dangerman ( ) - bob leaper orchestra27: main theme from  quot;twin peaks quot; - from twin peaks ( ) - angelo badalamenti28: the animlas come out - from  quot;taxi driver quot; - bernard herrmannand after all that, the album weighs in at just under 55 minutes.in the main this is a great album.  however there is one major blemish and a couple of minor ones in my opinion.  tha major one would have to be track 16,  quot;guaglione quot;.  i cannot tell you how much this song annoyed me whilst it was being played 24-7 on the television as the theme tune for the guness advert.  a couple of years down the line and it s still no better.  i just cannot stand this piece of music - i just have to skip over it every time it comes on.the minor blemishes are just that, minor.  the  quot;joe 90 quot; tune has never been one that i have really apperciated, and likewise  quot;you never can tell quot;.  but then that s just me.  you might love them.as a compilation album full of cultish tunes theres a fair chance that you ll know at least a few of the tunes already, which isn t a bad thing.  it means that you already feel comfortable with the album when you first put it in, rather than having to go through that uncomfortable phase of having to get to know this.on the whole this is a good buy, not essential by any means, but a good listen all the same.

christmas prize challenge.please see the challenge rules as set out below that i have to follow to write my little piece.this year, i am challenging members in a prize competition for christmas. the concept is an easy one, and here a little bit of mingling with other members is essential for it to work, and i thought it is kind of nice at this time of year to socialise with members and for people to enter the competition with community spirit in mind, and enjoy the challenge.what you need to do to enter the challenge is to message members of ciao, and ask each of them for one word. each member should be of a different colour, so as to encourage participation right across the ciao site. it is to be kept to private guest books. otherwise it will spoil the surprise element of the challenge. if someone changes colour in the meantime, that   s ok, but when they give you the word, each must be of differing colour. that way, you get to know a cross section of ciao, and everyone gets involved which is what christmas is all about, getting to know one another and involving others in something that can turn out to be good fun.the only colour excluded (unless you catch them when they are not busy) is gold because we only have two gold members and it would not be fair to burden them with too many messages all for the same challenge.when you have words from each member, you must list them at the beginning of your challenge piece, with the name of the person that gave you the word, their colour of dot and the word they gave.thenyou must write a piece using all the words that other members have given you. it can be a joke, poem, essay, story, review, anything in fact that uses all of those words. this must be as imaginative as possible and one liners are really not what the challenge is about. it is about using those words to their best effect in a written piece of work, one that challenges the writer and that challenges the reader.you can make it seasonal if you wish, or really anything that you like, but before you can begin, you need to collect ten words from other members.there will be a prize for this challenge, and judges will be chosen from members, one of each colour on the site so that we get a fair cross section of people on ciao because this is their christmas challenge. it is for anyone who wishes to participate.have fun people.p.s. i am not exempt from the challenge and promise that as soon as people on the site understand the concept of the challenge and have given me their words, i shall write my own, because not doing so would be a copout    good luck. please cut and paste the challenge into your review, so people know the rules. thanks. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;

in 2005, jeremy dyson, mark gatiss, steve pemberton and reece shearsmith collaborated on league of gentlemen: apocalypse, a film version of their successful bbc 2 tv series.league of gentlemen: apocalypse tells the story of what happens when the four writers of the league of gentlemen, try to leave behind a collection of characters that refuse to be killed off. the weird and wonderful residents of royston vasey manage to find a way into the real world and face a number of challenges in order to save their town, which is a facing an apocalypse. the writers all play themselves, with the exception of jeremy dyson, who is played by michael sheen.i was a big fan of the tv series and i really liked this film as well. mark gatiss, steve pemberton and reece shearsmith play the many characters from royston vasey and do a fantastic job, with the likes of papa lazarou and tubbs sharing scenes together. i thought having herr lipp kidnapping steve pemberton and imitating him was an interesting idea. my favourite character is papa lazarou, but i found myself loving all the characters in this film. this is a nice twist to the story that gives a fitting resolution to the characters of royston vasey.

for those of you at the milton keynes bowl that day, im sure you ll all join me in saying what an awesome day it was and for those of you who couldnt make it, this dvd is the next best thing. linkin park always put on a great show no matter where you seem them, seemless everytime plus with this dvd you get the added bonus of seeing them collaborate with jay z on their final two songs, numb/encore and jigga what/faint.with 3 albums behind them now they have a excellent play list which shows the diversity of the two front men. you wanna rock out like a madman, they ll cater for it, you wanna chill out with your hands in the air, they ll cater for it, you wanna bounce, they ll cater for it with this dvd you can see the guys in action and then put the cd on when you get in the car. always handy. the only reason i havent given this 5 stars is because you dont get to see any of the previous acts throughout the day which included nerd, the bravery, innerpartysystem, pendulum, enter shikari and an excellent jay z set one day after glastonbury

sahib ( master) bibi ( mistress) aur ( and) ghulam ( slave)this is yet another great classic from the talented guru dutt...based on famed bengali writer bimol mitro s novel , this is the story of  bengal s decaying feudalism..the decadent lifestyle of the zamindars (land owners) at the end of the 19th century bengal is shown in this masterpiece of a movie..a magnificent film with some extraordinarily beautiful photography and extraordinary song picturizations and brilliant performances by the star cast...truly a masterpiece..guru dutt was eons ahead of his time, and, in this film along with writer /director abrar alvi , he scripted the story of  adultery that was far ahead of its times .hindi film industry was not ready to accept it as it was written , hence, they had to change the story line to suit the mindset of the general public and the distributors at that time..the storythe story is told in flashbacks..it is the story of a zamindari family and the tale of its daughter in law . sahib  is the rich pampered zamindaar ,  bibi  is his wife and ghulam which translates slave or servant.the 3 main characters of the film.the zamindar brothers are  a rich pampered lot generally neglecting  their  wives, spending their days pigeon racing or tormenting the poor farmers, at the same time being taken for a royal ride by their own accountants and preferring to spend  the evenings and nights in the  company of alcohol and dancing girls. here the younger daughter in law of the family is determined to make her husband come to her and spend more time with her. she is not given any support by the other ladies of the house, as they believe that, this is a system that needs to be followed by their rich husbands. and as long as they are kept in wealth and comfort it was alright for the men to do what they want.. but the enchantingly beautiful choti bahu (younger daughter in law) takes it as a challenge to change things and she is prepared to go to any lengths to do this, even to the extent of consuming  alcohol like the dancing girls did, a taboo for women belonging to  high caste hindu  families... comes a young villager called bhootnath , an architect ,employed by the household, totally mesmerised by the haunting beauty of the choti bahu, ready to do anything for her, becomes her liasion ,as she desperately tries to conspire and win her spouse back from the charms of the courtesans ..but the the young architect s platonic relationship with the aristocrats wife is misunderstood  by the household and there is a scandal ..the cast and my viewsi consider this as one of the best made hindi films of all times.it is a superb film , a dramatic film that keeps you spellbound and stays in your memory forever....the movie  belongs to the tremendously sensitive and  touching portrayal of the young choti bahu by meena kumari who looks mesmerising and ravishing , she is the heart and the soul of the film..this was the ultimate  role written for any actress and meena kumari s portrayal of the role can only be described in superlatives ....she really has given a flawless and tremendous performance. i personally consider this as one of her best roles, other than pakeezah which was her last film...guru dutt , as bhootnath too has put in his best , he has a much lighter role as compared to his previous brooding intellectual ones ..but i personally have always felt  that guru dutt is any day a better director than an actor..waheeda rehman as jaba, the charming young girl interested in bhootnath is grace personified and provides some lighter moments . i especially liked her emoting for the lovely and naughty song    bhanwara bada naadan hai...character actor rehman as choti bahu s husband is adequate in his role as the self indulgent, pampered alcoholic and womaniser..guru dutt has cleverly highlighted the status of women of those days by not giving a name to meena kumari;s role. she is simply known as chhoti bahu (the younger daughter in law), known only by her relation to the zamindari household...the songs from this film are beautifully picturised..my own favourite being   piya aiso jiya mein samaye gayo re   sung by geeta dutt, it is lovely to watch the picturisation where meena kumari is elaborately getting dressed and waiting for her husband. each time i watch this song i keep speculating about the color of the georgeous bengali silk saree that choti bahu drapes on her self and the way her hair is plaited and twined etc: a  beautiful and artistic way of filming a song, with that special guru dutt touch...geeta dutt s rendering of the three  songs for meena kumari   koi door se awaaz de chale aao,   piya aiso jiya mein   and   na jao saiyan churake bhaiyyan   represents some of the finest singing she has ever done. her voice with all its sensuality and pain complements meena kumari s performance perfectly. ...the black and white photography and cinematography by dutt favorite vk murthy is stunning.this is an enthralling human drama about relationships that will haunt you forever . ..sahib bibi aur ghulam went on to win filmfare awards for best film, director, actress and photography.the film was also screened at the berlin film festival in june 1963 and was india s official entry to the oscars that year.cast and crewstarring : meena kumari, guru dutt,

padosan(neighbor)is probably one of the most hilarious movies ever made in hindi film industry.padosan is an out and out comedy film of the sixties...the kishore kumar-mehmood pairing had earlier tickled ribs in   pyar kiye jaa  (1966 ) which was a very successful musical .kishore kumar was a rare comic talent and one of the most talented personalities of the hindi film industry.besides being a superb singer,he was also a great composer , a very talented comedian leading man and a producer/director.truly  multi faceted personality..in fact this  film is a showcase of the combined comic talents of  mehmood and kishore kumar, both of whom  went berserk here in this movie. padosan has got other top class comedians like om prakash, mukri, keshto mukherjee and sundar. padosan produced by mehmood, has perhaps one of the best performances by mehmood in his entire career.based on arun chowdhury s bengali story  pasher bari  , padosan has a premise which promises to be a rich mine of laughs and more laughs..the story of padosan~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~bhola(sunil dutt) is a simpleton an orphan brought up by his uncle(omprakash) .the uncle is planning to get married again having seperated from his wife.bhola is very angry at this and he has a heated argument with his uncle over the issue of his uncle s second marriage proposal, after which he  leaves his house and goes to stay with his estranged aunt.bhola who is 26 years old , realises that as per the scriptures ,he too has already wasted a year of his grahastashram (married life). keen to make amends, he decides to take the plunge as soon as possible.the only problem is to find the right girl.he comes across a lovely girl in the neighboring house of his aunt with whom he is staying  and decides that she is his ideal mate.but the girl, bndu (saira bano) is not interested in him . at the same time she seems to be very close to her south indian music teacher pillai( mehmood), who seems to be  a constant visitor at her place, which makes things difficult for bhola.bhola meets his freind vidyapati known as guru (kishore kumar)  , a reputed singer and requests him and his other friends  to help him. guru after observing bindu with the music teacher comes to the conclusion  that bindu is more interested in learning music than in the music teacher.so they decide on a plan of action wherein  bhola would be taught  classical music by guru...but, that proves to be  an uphill task since  bhola has nether any musical sense nor is he able to identify  any of the tunes.they next think of a great idea where  guru will playback for bhola while bhola lipsyncs for the songs.....some hilarious episodes follow and bhola manages to get the attention of bindu....what happens when she comes to know the real facts about bholas singing and master pillai s reactopn to all this forms the hilarious continuation and end to  this film and makes for one of the most entertaining films ever made in hindi cinema.my views about   padosan ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i would rate both kishore kumar and mehmood equally high in the comic sequences, togethet they are a riot.there is a song ( ek chatur naar karke singaar) competetion between the two trying to impress bindu,with sunil dutt (bhola)  lip syncing and ,it is one of the most hilarious scenes ever with mehmood(pillai) falling  almost out of the balcony as he pursues the beauteous bindu.  mehmood makes an uproariously funny sight in a rolled-up dhoti,  a bright bald pate and a  ponytail. kishore kumar too is dhoti-clad, paan- chewing sporting  a mop of middle-parted hair that flops each time he breaks into one of his  musical frenzies..and he does it so naturally ..sunil dutt too is great in his role as the naive and gullible bhola. not many heroes would have considered this role macho enough. but fortunately for sunil dutt it paid off and he has come up with a warm likeable performance..beautiful saira bano as the spoilt, arrogant yet so likeable bindu looks ravishing and i simply love her churidaar sets in lovely shades of pink, white and black, and the lovely colorful sarees.she looks absolutely devine with her flawless ,  perfect features and those feminine graceful looks.she gets a lot of important scenes to herself and she makes a tremendous impact in this film.the comic sequences in this film are side splitting, and the film is laced with some great music by r d burmanthe musical score adds considerably to the hilarious proceedings.the song picturisation remain amusing. in  quot;kehna hai, kehna hai quot; an excited bhola and masterji break into a farcical waltz, and  in the ever popular   quot;mere saamne wali khidki mein, a paint box, a paan ka dibba( a silver box used for keeping beetle leaves and nuts)  and a broom serve as musical instruments.. talented composer r.d.burman got his big break as a music  director of repute with one of mehmods earlier films  chhote nawab  , they did another film  bhoot bangla   together and padosan is perhaps the most successful musical score for r.d.burman.kishore kumar gets to sing what is perhaps one of the most popular songs tuned by rd  quot;mere samne wali khidki mein...it was and is a rage to this day..in padosan, rd burman has given lata mangeshkar two lovely solos, the peppy   bhai battoor  and the romantic  sharam aati hai magar  and lata as usual has come up with some melodious singing, while  his wife asha bhosle had to share her only song, main chali main chali with lata mangeshkar..the list of songs in padosan~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    mere saamne wali khidki mein -kishore kumar   bhai bhatur -lata mangeshkar   ek chatur naar karke shingaar -kishore kumar, manna dey   kehna hai kehena hai -kishore kumarmain chali main chali  - lata mangeshkarmere bhole balam -kishore kumarsharm aati hai magar -lata mangeshkarsanwariya sanwariya -manna deydetails of the dvd~~~~~~~~~~~~~~starring: sunil dutt, mehmood,saira bano,kishore kumar,agha,mukhri,keshto mukherji,om prakashdirector: jyoti swaroopproducer: mehmoodmusic composer: r.d.burmansingers: kishore kumar,lata mangeshkar, manna dey, asha bhonslegenre: comedyrunning time: 2 hours 30 minutesvideo category: bollywood feature filmcountry of origin: indiaformat: dvdlanguage: hindisubtitle language: english

lata mangeshkar is one of the best known voices from the hindi films.she is known as the nightingale of india, is literally the face of indian film industry. her songs have become an inseparable part of the daily lives of indians all over..she has come to symbolise india in a way no other person has or ever will....born into a traditional middle class family based in goa..her father dinanath mangeshkar was a classical singer, who trained lata mangeshkar in indian classical singing.lata was the eldest daughter.when her father died, lata was just 13 years old and had to shoulder the responsibility of looking after her mother and four siblings...with the help of a family friend ,she began acting and singing in theaters and later graduated to play back singing..there was no looking back for lata once her songs became a rage with the audience.aayega aanewala , from the film  mahal  composed by composer kemchand gave her career the boost that was needed, and lata began to find a firm footing in the industry that was dominated by noor jehan,suraiya and raj kumari , most of who were singing in high pitched nasal voices.lata changed the whole concept of singing with her clear melodious voice and unique style of singing.she rose steadily and conquered the hindi film industry..the undisputable singing queen.to this day, there has never been a singer of her range and calibre..there have been many clones who fail to come anywhere close to her .the album legend has some of her best songs in the 2 cd set.the haunting and unforgettable melody  aayega aanewala  from mahal (1949)which was the turning point in her career , the romantic  thandi hawaayein from naujawan, an ever green from s.d.burman...to lag ja gale from the hauntingly suspenseful  woh kaun thi , rahe na rahe hum from  mamata ...33 tracks in all..truly an album worth collecting.i cant think of a single bad song here...they have been carefully selected to make one fine collectionthe sound quality is excellent and the packaging beautiful...there are many of my favorites here including the ones i mentioned above- i love  hawa mein udhta jaaye mera laal dupatta , from raj kapoor s  barsaat  lata sounds so very innocent during the fifties.it is difficult actually choose any favorites here , as the selection of songs is awesome and has been carefully selected right from the forties to the seventies and even early eighties - yaara seeli seeli is one of the eighties songs picturised on dimple.lata souds as good as she did iduring the seventies, a more mature voice with a lot more depth in it.this one is a collectors item..the album details and the list of songs as follows...track listcd1:1 baras baras badli2 aayega aanewala3 hawa mein udta jaaye4 thandi hawayen5 ghar aaya mera pardesi6 mohe bhool gaye7 yeh zindagi usiki hai8 mera dil yeh pukare aaja9 rasik balma10 guzara hua zamana11 aye malik tere bandhe ham12 aaja re pardesi13 basanti pawan pagal14 pyar kiya to darna kya15 allah tero naam16 aap ki nazron ne samjha17 lag ja gale18 piya tose naina laage recd2:1 tumhi mere mandir1 yeh sama sama hai3 tuu jahan jahan chalega4 tumhe yaad karte karte5 rahen na rahen hum6 kya janoon sajan7 kitni akeli kitni tanha8 hamne dekhi hai9 chalte chalte10 megha chhaye11 kaanta laga12 aap yuun faslon se13 satyam shivam sundaram14 dikhayi diye yuun15 yaara seeli seeli...

i love hindi film songs , romantic duets more so..the rafi-lata, rafi-asha, mukesh-lata, talat-lata, hemant - asha,hemant - lata, mannadey - lata, heady combinations....there are so many of them in our good old movies, and all so very melodious.when there is a dvd with romantic duets from the old films one  can buy it without a second thought.most of those old duets were beautifully picturised with those manly heroes dev anand,dharmendra, shammi kapoor, manoj kumar, rajenfra kumar and the lovely ladies vyjayanti mala, asha parekh, sadhana, mala sinha ...ah  those were the days...this dvd has some very good selection of duets from the sixties and the seventies.. aap ko pyar chupane ki  bekhudi mein sanam  and many more...17 tracks in all..

this 3 pack dvd has two great blockbusters from the golden era namely chhalia (1960)and china town(1962), although the other film dayar-e-madina , a muslim social relatively little known..chhalia has an impressive star cast of raj kapoor, nutan, rehman and pran ,and an equally impressive music score by composers kalyanji anandji.chhalia is by no means one of nutan s best films, in fact it compares poorly with the raj kapoor-nutan starrer  anadi  ...the story line is a bit complicated at times, with too many twists and turns...but the music is pleasing especially mukesh songs dum dum diga diga    chalia mera naam and  mere toote hue dil mein.. and lata s  tere rahon mein khade hai   and  baje paayal cham cham ....worth watching a great actress like nutan in any film, and picturisation of the melodious songs...coming to china town..shammi kapoor-shakila starrer, directed by shakti samantha who gave us classics like howrah bridge,sawan ki ghata,aradhana, amar prem...i love this film for its foot tapping and melodious music by ravi..baar baar dekho, hum se na poocho hum kahan chale, kya teri mehfil hai sanam, bada qatil hai...and of course shammi kapooran action packed thriller, like his previous films, shakthi samantha manages to keep one interested throughout.shakila and shammi kapoor look good together and the rest of the star cast includes helen,madan puri and jeevan kala..not to be missed by any shammi kapoor fan.the third film dayar e madina is a relatively  little known 1975 film , a muslim social, which has a star cast of nazima, hina kauser,tabrez and imtiaz, all of them not well  known actors except nazima, who has made a mark for herself in excellent supporting roles . the music is by mohammad d shafi, who has scored impressive music for older films like dara,shikarpuri and bazoobund...i would definitely buy this dvd as it has 2 classics in chhalia and china town..

garmin are a relatively new company when it comes to gps (global positioning systems), yet with this product the seem set to face up to competitors tomtom and the like. what is it?in a nutshell, this is a microsd (memory card) that slots in to your windows mobile, palm, or symbian phone; which in turn gives you a gps navigation system at your fingertips. you need never get lost again - wherever you are in europe. it also provides coverage where you wouldn t have normal phone signal - which means you have directions when you need them the most. in fact, you can even check for traffic, weather   cctv cameras.the card itself is tiny, yet provides state-of-the-art 3d graphics on your handset. it makes tomtoms sound pointless and means your car will never get broken in to for your sat-nav.perhaps the best feature of the garmin mobile xt is that it also has voice directions. there is literally nothing better about an expensive satnav than this. in fact, this product is better due to its portability and ease of use.please note that if you are a blackberry user, this product will not work for you - however garmin have made a similar product especially for the blackberry: https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cid=138 pid=6302to buy or not to buy?buy. if you travel much and have a windows mobile, then it seem stupid not to. there is nothing i can fault about the software, it seems reasonably priced and is much more portable than a satnav. 5/5minimum requirements and compatible handsets.minimum requirements for windows mobile   , palm    and symbian    devices: 16mb program memory, 128mb storage card minimum (256mb or more recommended), 2gb storage card for full coverageamoi n8amoi n800amoi n810asus p526asus p527asus p535asus p750at t tiltbenq-siemens p51black jack 2dopod cht 9100dopod cht 9110dopod d810dopod p800wdopod u1000e-ten glofiish m700e-ten glofiish x500e-ten glofiish x800e-ten infotouch g500e-ten infotouch g500+fujitsu-siemens pocket loox t810fujitsu-siemens pocket loox t830gigabyte g-smart i300gigabyte g-smart i350hp ipaq 600/610/612/614hp ipaq 900/910/912/914hp ipaq hw6510hp ipaq hw6515hp ipaq hw6910 / hw6920 / hw6940hp ipaq hw6915 / hw6925 / hw6945 / hw6965htc advantage x7500htc advantage x7501htc omnihtc p3300htc p3600htc p4550htc p5500htc p6550htc polarishtc s420htc s640htc s730htc tilthtc touch cruisehtc tytn iihtc voguehtc x9500intermec cn3izen mobile krmaizen mobile ksmtmitac mio a501mitac mio a700mitac mio a701mitac mio a702motorola mc35motorola q globalnokia n95nokia 6110 navigatoro2 xda orbitorange spv m650orange spv m700orsio g735samsung sgh-i640vsfr s300+t-mobile mda ameot-mobile mda compact iiit-mobile mda vario iiitorq n100vodafone vpa compact gpsvodafone vpa compact vxpa v1510xpa v1520xpa v1615    bruno crosier 2008

quot;kingdom of heaven is an epic adventure about a common man who finds himself thrust into a decades long war.  a stranger in a strange land, he serves a doomed king, falls in love with an exotic and forbidden queen, and rises to knighthood.  ultimately he must protect the people of jerusalem from overwhelming forces while striving to keep a fragile peace. quot;  ........................(producer s synopsis) gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;before i begin:i m not going to discuss the costumes or the script - i don t actually notice what people are wearing, or think of the dialogue as a  quot;script quot; most of the time, as it is too real to me -- i look at people s eyes and faces and reactions -- i don t even notice special effects that much - unless they are so wooden even i notice....  i noticed the blood gushing and splurting effects (but then, they were face, neck and chin), and remembered that long after the film had finished.... and shuddered...  but, i wanted to hear the dialogue again - which means i felt it was realistic and/or meaningful - if it was  quot;invented quot; by the screenwriter - he did a good job.  my reactions were coloured by what it made me want to do rather than what it made me feel; perhaps it is not a good film for me to review, but i wanted to share the combination/mixed reactions of my horror at the blood and the stirrings of conscience and thrill of the quest fulfilled.  i didn t know what to expect, but, had i known what i know now, before i went, i would have said that i enjoyed it more than i expected to.do i recommend this?  yes, but with reservations - having had to cover my eyes several times when blood was explicitly spurting and gushing from neck and chin gashes during the hand-to-hand conflicts.  i was quite disturbed by the violence in the film and the bloodiness - i have personally not watched a film before that disturbed me so much.  i think what made the violence more disturbing than that in the passion and troy was how much it was  quot;in your face quot; in this film; and possibly the fact that some of the combatants were  quot;christians quot; killing  quot;christians quot; with what seemed to be little provocation.  i wondered that it was not designated  quot;18 quot; here in the uk despite its lack of foul language, sex and nudity.  the uk classification is  quot;15 quot; in the 145 minute  quot;cut quot; version which is being shown in the cinema.  the dvd  quot;director s cut quot; (285 minutes) is said to include a lot of deleted scenes.  i wonder what those who said it was long will make of the dvd version (an extra two hours ).  i expect that the abruptness mentioned in some reviews may be due to there being no easy way to remove certain  quot;provocative quot; scenes without disturbing the flow.  there were so many quotes i wanted to remember - i have listed a few below under the heading  quot;memorable moments of wisdom quot; - it was a very thought provoking film - partly because of what it said, partly because of what it didn t say - and because it made you think about our own source of conscience, our own ability to discern god s will, and even the ultimate question as to how christians can affirm their beliefs while charitably engaging people of other religions.because i would have wanted to read it before i went, i have included a summary of historical background (from a christian s point of view), and have indicated which of the characters actually existed in my cast list.  i found this information essential in understanding some of the nuances of the film; initially i placed this before the actual review, but due to some comments i have moved this into an appendix at the end.  i have also included at the end some comments made by inamul haq, an adjunct professor of islam in illinois, in conversation with a christian friend, the day after they watched the film together.i felt that he expressed better than i could, what the muslim reaction to this film would be. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;and  now  - the  film  -  kingdom  of  heaven gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;the story begins  (as i understood it)between the 2nd and 3rd crusades, the christian kingdom of jerusalem is at peace, while an uneasy truce exists between king baldwin iv and salah-ad-din, following a victory by the young king many years before when he was only 16.  one successful knight, (the fictitious) godfrey of ibelin, finding himself without an heir, decides to seek his illegitimate son, beg his forgiveness, and bring him back to the holy land to support the leprous king baldwin iv in his endeavour to keep the more fanatic elements of the crusaders from their murder of muslim civilians.the film begins by telling us that the christians have held jerusalem for nearly a hundred years, it is 1184, europe is  quot;in a state of repression and poverty quot; and that a knight is seeking his son.his son is balian (orlando bloom), a village blacksmith in france, whose wife committed suicide after the death of their only child.  we see her body being desecrated below a white cross on the wayside as the knight s retinue approaches the village.  the local priest removes the golden crucifix from her neck and orders her head cut off before she is allowed to be placed in the ground.  the priest then          pictures of kingdom of heaven (dvd)

after the kids saw the advert for this cd/dvd on tv, i was nagged into getting it.  after trundling off to woolies and departing with my    7.99, when i placed this double compilation on in the car i was given a pleasant surprise.   i m fortunate enough to have both a good sound system and a dvd player in the back and on long journeys thats a bonus. my kids are aged 2, 5 and 7 and they approve so that s a good recommendation.  the dvd is part of universal productions and i thought for a second i had been given an epic feature film instead of a compilation of pop videos.  its classified e for exempt, which means you have no worries about naughty bits being seen or bad words being said.  there is no eminen on here.another good reason to buy it apart from keeping the kids entertained is that the artist s royalties went to comic relief.  with having both the cd and dvd, its double value as the kids can listen or watch in and out of the car.  some of the songs are a bit naff but how many people actually buy a cd and enjoy every single track?  there s always a few  quot;odd quot; ones thrown in but all in all it s a good cd. here s a review on just why it s so good and a brief description of the tracks and the accompanying dvd to the songs.*    not all the songs have a dvd equivalent.  there are 24 songs listed and 16 pop  quot;videos quot; on the dvd.  lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 1:  busted - thunderbirds are go gt; gt; gt; gt;just love the tune, very catchy, my kids think it s the best even though the film itself was a big let down.  you find yourself singing along to the entire track without realising.  this one isn t on the dvd, which i found quite hard to believe, as this was such a good one to watch, mtv plugged it enough. lt; lt; lt; lt;track 2:  tony christie and peter kay - amarillo gt; gt; gt; gt;say no more, a hit in the 70 s and again for comic relief in 2005.  so darn cheesy but addictive to sing to.  what a shame the comic relief video isn t on the dvd that clip with ronnie corbett gets the kids laughing all the time. lt; lt; lt; lt;track 3: hi 5- boom boom beat gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;i liked it when it first came out but now it grates on me, my kids rate it full marks though.  annoying tune and thankfully no video clip to report on. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 4: bob the builder - can we fix it  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; quot;scoop, muck and dizzy and rollie too,              bet you know the words before i do   if you want to hear this track its on cbeebies every day and its bob the builders theme tune.  can t see it ever being forgotten, just like an abba track, always in your mind.  no clip for it on the dvd, which is strange, but he hoh i didn t put this together. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 5: aqua - i m a barbie girl  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;i just love aqua, totally mad and wish they would release another hit.  the tune is impossible to sit still too and the clip is just as addictive to watch.  it s a very  quot;pink quot; video set inside a studio with lots of backdrops.  it obviously cost them next to nothing to produce but goes well with the lyrics.  excellent. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 6: sugarbabes - angels with dirty faces  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;good song, not too  quot;hectic quot; and quite pleasant on the ear.  though not a sugarbabes fan, i must admit i like this track.  the pop video is a cartoon featuring the girl band as the power puff girls and they become super hero s fighting off aliens and robots.totally stupid but likeable. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 7:  s club juniors - one step closer  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;   . to heaven baby, one-step closer to you.  yuk   so cheesy you can smell the edam coming from the cd player.  thank fully the video isn t quite as bad to watch  and s club 7 is on the dvd with  quot;reach quot;.  that s far more bearable.   lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 8: mcfly - five colours in her hair  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;mcfly - where s my swot   enough said, awful song, a boy band still wet in the pants and a lousy boring video.  fast forward          . lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 9: ozone - dragostea din tei  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;i just love it   haven t a clue what this german group are singing about but its brilliant.  can t keep your foot still.  the lead singer has such a sexy voice when he starts the chorus line.  the video is based around the band standing on an aeroplane wing with their open shirts flapping.  yeah ok, whatever floats their boat  lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 10:  engie benjy - enjie benjy engine man  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;the itv equivalent to little red tractor meets bob the builder.  no video but catchy theme tune. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 11:  the archies - sugar sugar  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;i remember this first time round but hate to admit it.  i m sure you all know this if over 30 years young   a quality song from the 1970 s with no video though. quot;sugar sugar,  heh honey honey, you are my candy girl and you got me wanting you quot;.got it??? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 12: steps - 5,6, 7, 8  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;hate the song; my kids love it, another cheesy offering.  the video is shot on an exotic location with some bikini lovelies who have no cellulite and pert baps, bitches the men of the band are wearing magnum p.i. type shirts, open to the waist to reveal hairless chests.  no tom jones look a likes here.  the dance moves i found hard to follow, as the video is so quick, flitting from one section to the other.  my kids already knew it without watching, enough said       . lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 13: fast food rockers - fast food song gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; quot;oh pizza hut, oh pizza hut, kentucky friend chicken and a pizza hut - mc donalds, mcdonalds          quot; bet you know it   i know the actions to this and we all do it in the car, not when i m behind the wheel though.  awful video, totally weird outfits, reminds me of the jetsons cartoon characters but i love it.  a guaranteed kids party winner. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 14: dj casper - cha cha slide  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;clip starts off with dj casper on active news one and a group of people in new york all learning the cha cha slide.  great beat, quite fast but the clip makes it easy to follow the steps.  all ages can tackle the cha cha slide as this clip goes out to show.   quot;how low can you go       . take it back now yar  quot;  you ll be humming for ages. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 15: arnie and barnie worm - nk jnr lunch time song gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;if you haven t seen it, tune into nick junior on sky.  it s a fun song that encourages kids to wash their hands before eating at lunchtime.  good fun song. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 16 : vengaboys - we like to party gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;mad video and equally mad song, it will do your head in be warned. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 17: kylie minogue - i should be so lucky  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;no video but i m sure nearly everyone has seen this.  i ve nothing against kylie but this track is so old now, it s annoying.  i like her newer stuff and even the kids wanted this track moved on. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 18:  s club 7 : reach  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;good strong beat, not too heavy on the ear dreams.  video very  quot;happy quot;, bit like a clip from friends on c4.   lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 19: dj otzi : hey baby  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;get your arms ready, lets do that mexican wave.  a great party song once you ve had a few glasses and good sensible tracks for kidlets to listen to.  full marks to this one.whatever happened to dj otzi???? lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 20: schnappi - das kleine krokodill gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;funny little animated video; it s about crocodiles dancing around egyptian figures.  sung in german, haven t a clue what this child is singing.  very annoying at first but its really grown on us all. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 21: cartoons - witch doctor  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;an odd video with lots of women in elvis costumes and men wearing the most horrendous mexican wigs.  a cheesy song that is annoyingly catchy and grows on you. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 22: tweenies - have fun go mad  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;the tweenies doing rap, sorry no way.  the video is just as bad with the only entertaining bit is milo playing the saxophone.  even my kids fast-forward this.  sorry tweenies. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 23: h and claire - beauty and the beast gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;this is the theme tune from the disney movie and very relaxing, almost to the point of nodding off.  as a couple they sing well, shame they didn t progress further.  no video to this. lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt; lt;track 24: elton john - can you feel the love tonight  gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;from the lion king, a fantastic film and song to match it.  a real chill out song that gives this cd a great finale.check out umtv/co.uk/childrensthis cd is available almost anywhere from amazon to wh smiths.  i paid    7.99 in woolies.  you can t msiss the cover, its bright and cheery.  i m looking forward to pop jnr 2 hopefully.thanks for reading.

some cats are false friendsthere are lots of idioms and proverbs around the cat, my beloved specie and just for fun i started  to collect them.i will present you some of them, sometimes slightly different from german to english:the german   8222;katzenjammer quot; (lit. translated: cats-lamentation) means   8222;hang-over quot; in english, but english   8222;to be hung over quot; (lit. translated:    berh   ngen) would be in german   8222;einen kater haben quot; (lit. translated: to have a tom-cat)the german   8222;die katze im sack kaufen quot; (lit. translated: to buy a cat in a bag) means   8222;to buy a pig in a poke quot; (lit. translated: ein einget   tes schwein kaufen). i guess, neat animals as cats would get furios if they knew they would be taken for pigs...butno differences are for   8222;die katze aus dem sack lassen = to let the cat out of the bag quot;.  8222;wie hund und katze leben = to lead a cat-and-dog life quot;, but  8222;wie die katze um den hei   en brei schleichen quot; (lit. translated: to sneak around hot pap as a cat)  is equivalent to   8222;to beat about the bush quot; (lit. translated auf den busch klopfen = fish for information - even cats like fish and fishing, even for compliments).no differences are for   8222;mit jemandem katz und maus spielen = play cat and mouse quot; and   8222;bei nacht sind alle katzen grau = all cats are gray in the dark quot;, but  8222;ist die katze aus dem haus, tanzen die m   use auf dem tisch quot; has been abbreviated to   8222;when the cat s away, the mice will play quot;, probably because english mice don  8216;t dance on the kitchentable?english cats get older, because   8222;a cat has nine lives quot; (lit. translated: katzen haben sieben leben), so where are the missing two for german cats?i couldn  8216;t find an equivalent for   8222;du machst ein gesicht wie eine katze, wenn s donnert quot; (lit. translated: your face looks like a cats one when it  8216;s thundering quot;) meaning to look quite frightened, but   8222;to look like the cat who swallowed the canary = du machst ein gesicht wie eine katze, die einen kanarienvogel verschluckt hat quot; for someone who is proud of himself is even known in german.while german people   8222;sehen, wie der hase l   uft quot; (lit. translated: see how the hare runs), englishmen   8222;see how the cat jumps quot; or   8222;wait for the cat to jump quot; (lit. translated: warten bis die katze springt - und warten erstmal ab.)when german people say   8222;das ist f   r die katz quot; (lit. translated: that  8216;s for the cat) it  8216;s a complete waste and not a present and   8222;das hat wohl die katze gefressen quot; (lit.translated: that was eaten by the cat) means, something has vanished.some further idioms:  8222;katzenw   sche quot; is a   8222;cat-lick quot; and   8222;katzenmusik quot; is   8222;caterwauling quot;,  8222;katzentisch quot; is the childrens table and   8222;katzenauge quot; is   8222;cat  8216;s eye quot;, in double meaning, once for a semie precious stone, once for the rear reflector on a bike or so.  8222;katzensprung quot; is   8222;a stone  8216;s throw quot;, though i think most people can throw a stone wider than a cat can jump.an english   8222;catfish quot; is a german   8222;seewolf quot; (lit. translated: seawolf),  8222;cat-ice quot;

... =^..^= ...  =`x   = ...  =(^-^)= ... ,,,^..^,,, ...  gt;^o^ lt; ***************************************************ok, for those of you who understand german, i will let you read my german opinion, posted on ciao.de:some c   ts are false friendses gibt eine unmenge an ausdr   cken, redewendungen und sprichw   rtern, die sich um die katze drehen, und da ich diese tiere, wie man wei   , besonders liebe, hab ich irgendwann angefangen, nicht nur lebende exemplare zu sammeln, sondern auch alles weitere drumherum, so auch im sprachlichen bereich. einiges von dem, was ich bislang zusammengetragen habe, will ich nun vorstellen, speziell das, was sich auf den unterschied zwischen dem deutschen und dem englischen bezieht.unser deutsches wort   8222;katzenjammer quot; (w   rtl.    bers.: cats-lamentation) entspricht dem englischen   8222;hang-over quot;, wobei das englische   8222;to be hung over quot; (w   rtl.    bers.:    berh   ngen) allerdings bei uns jedoch dem   8222;einen kater haben quot; (w   rtl.    bers.: to have a tom-cat) entspricht.wo wir   8222;die katze im sack kaufen quot; (w   rtl.    bers.: to buy a cat in a bag) kauft der engl   nder ein einget   tes schwein   8222;to buy a pig in a poke quot;... au weia, so reinliche tiere wie katzen w   rden aus der haut fahren, oder sich beleidigt abwenden, wenn man sie mit schweinen verwechseln w   rde...aberzwischen dem   8222;die katze aus dem sack lassen quot; und   8222;let the cat out of the bag quot; gibt es keinen unterschied. ebensowenig bei   8222;wie hund und katze leben quot; und   8222;to lead a cat-and-dog life quot;, aber  8222;wie die katze um den hei   en brei schleichen quot; (w   rtl.    bers.: to sneak around hot pap as a cat) entspricht   8222;to beat about the bush quot;. b   se falle, denn unser   8222;auf den busch klopfen quot; meint ja etwas ganz anderes und die entsprechende englische redewendung daf   r lautet:   8222;to draw a bow at a venture quot;.   wiederum keinen unterschied gibt es zwischen   8222;mit jemandem katz und maus spielen quot; und   8222;play cat and mouse quot; sowie   8222;bei nacht sind alle katzen grau quot; und   8222;all cats are gray in the dark quot; bzw.   8222;in the dark (or when the candles are out) all cats are grey , jedoch  8222;ist die katze aus dem haus, tanzen die m   use auf dem tisch quot; wurde abgek   rzt zu   8222;when the cat s away, the mice will play quot;, vielleicht weil englische m   use nicht auf dem k   chentisch tanzen?auch werden englische katzen    lter als deutsche, denn   8222;a cat has nine lives quot; und ich frag mich, womit die deutschen verdient haben, da    ihnen zwei abgezogen wurden, denn wir sagen ja   8222;katzen haben sieben leben quot;. bislang konnte ich keine entsprechung finden f   r die redewendung   8222;du machst ein gesicht wie eine katze, wenn s donnert quot; (w   rtl.    bers.: your face looks like a cats one when it  8216;s thundering quot;) aber selbstgef   llige menschen werden hier wir dort mit einem gesicht   8222;wie eine katze, die einen kanarienvogel verschluckt hat quot; beschrieben:   8222;to look like the cat who swallowed the canary quot;. wir   8222;sehen, wie der hase l   uft quot; (w   rtl.    bers.: see how the hare runs), w   hrend engl   nder der katze beim springen zugucken   8222;see how the cat jumps quot;, aber vorsicht  sagt ein engl   nder, er w   rde   8222;wait for the cat to jump quot; (w   rtl.    bers.: warten bis die katze springt), dann wartet er die kommenden ereignisse erstmal ab...  8222;das ist f   r die katz quot; (w   rtl.    bers.: that  8216;s for the cat) hei   t auf englisch schn   de   8222;that  8216;s a complete waste quot; und was wir nach verzweifelter suche mit einem   8222;das hat wohl die katze gefressen quot; (lit.translated: that was eaten by the cat) bezeichnen, ist schlichtweg   8222;vanished quot;.zwischenspiel mit einzelnen ausdr   cken::  8222;katzenw   sche quot; ist   8222;cat-lick quot; und   8222;katzenmusik quot; ist   8222;caterwauling quot;,  8222;katzentisch quot; ist der   8222;childrens table quot; und   8222;katzenauge quot; ist   8222;cat  8216;s eye quot;, wobei es hier eine doppelte bedeutung gibt: einmal f   r einen halbedelstein, zum anderen f   r diese blinkenden reflektoren, die das licht widerspiegeln wie der augenhintergrund einer katze.   8222;katzensprung quot; ist   8222;a stone  8216;s throw quot;, obwohl ich vermute, da    die meisten menschen einen stein weiter werfen k   nnen als eine katze springen kann. der englische   8222;catfish quot; mutiert zum deutschen   8222;seewolf quot; (w   rtl.    bers.: seawolf),  8222;cat-ice quot; (w   rtl.    bers. katzeneis) bezeichnet eine unsichere eisschicht und unser nickerchen hei   t auf englisch   8222;cat-nap quot;.    berhaupt gibt es im englischen (irischen und amerikanischen) erstaunlicherweise weitaus mehr redewendungen und ausdr   cke als im deutschen...in irland gibt es zum beispiel den ausdruck   8222;a bag of cats quot; f   r schlechte laune wie in   8222;she s a real bag of cats this morning quot;. kein wunder, einget   tete katzen sind in der regel nicht gerade begeistert...ist etwas absolut aussichtslos, also ohne die geringste chance auf erfolg, hei   t es   8222;not a cat in hell s chance quot; oder   8222;as much chance as a wax cat in hell quot; und das wachs in der hitze schmilzt, wissen wir ja schon seit ikarus das fliegen    bte... das   8222;like herding cats quot;, d   rfte manchem seit dem genialen werbespot der firma eds, der letztes jahr furore macht, bekannt sein und ist eine umschreibung f   r das wort   8222;futile quot;, was mein lexikon mit leer, nichtig, unn   tz, nutzlos, aussichtslos, zwecklos, wirkungslos oder wertlos    bersetzt. eingebildete menschen werden als   8222;conceited as a barbers cat quot; (w   rt.    bers. eingebildet wie eine friseur  8216;s katze) bezeichnet, nun ja, manche katzen wissen, da    sie sch   n sind, speziell wenn sie beispielsweise f   r ausstellungen gef   hnt, gebadet oder sonstwie aufgemotzt wurden, aber es gibt wahrscheinlich auch jede menge umg   ngliche katzen in hair-styling-kreisen.den preis f   r etwas, was sehr teuer ist, bezeichnet man als   8222;high as the hair on a cat s back quot; , wobei wahrscheinlich eine teure, edle langhaarkatze pate gestanden hat.warum gebrechliche personen als   8222;weak as a cat quot; bezeichnet werden, ist mir schleierhaft, denn gerade katzen sind ja besonders z   h, und wer von einer   8222;fat cat quot; spricht, meint nicht etwa eine fette katze, sondern jemanden, der ein hohes tier mit viel geld ist.eine   8222;copycat quot;    fft jemanden nach, und eine   8222;alley cat quot; ist zwar wirklich eine heimatlose, streunende katze, allerdings, sobald dieser ausdruck auf ein weibliches wesen angewandt wird, ist damit eine dame des horizontalen gewerbes gemeint.auch nicht besonders nett ist es, wenn es    ber jemanden, der gerade herein- oder angekommen ist, abf   llig hei   t   8222;look what the cat dragged in quot; (w   rtl.    bers. schau, was die katze da angeschleppt hat).vor neugier wird gewarnt mit einem   8222;curiosity killed the cat quot;, andererseits beruhigt   8222;a cat can look at a king quot; (w   rtl.    bers. die katze darf den k   nig anschauen), denn niemand ist so wichtig, da    man als gew   hnlicher sterblicher nicht einen blick auf ihn riskieren d   rfte. dem geheimnisvollen schleichgang der katze abgeschaut ist die redewendung   8222;do it in a cat s paw quot;, wenn man ausdr   cken will, etwas zu tun, ohne da    andere mitbekommen, da    man der urheber ist. hat man sich allerdings erwischen lassen und federn gelassen, sieht also zerrupft oder ramponiert aus, hei   t es   8222;looks like something the cat brought in quot; (w   rtl.    bers. wie etwas, was die katze hereingebracht hat). man h   tte also etwas vorsichtiger oder h   flicher sein sollen... es gibt aber auch situationen, in den dies nicht angebracht ist, und man z   hne - oder krallen zeigen mu   :   8222;a cat in gloves catches no mice quot; (w   rt.    bers. eine katze mit handschuhen f   ngt keine m   use). mu    man gar, um ans ziel zu kommen, f   r aufruhr sorgen und ein st   rman   ver starten, geschieht dies am besten so:   8222;put, set, etc., {the cat among the pigeons} quot;, wobei keine meiner katze bislang eine taube gefangen hat... hat es einem die sprache verschlagen, hat die katze die zunge geklaut:   8222;cat got your tongue quot;, aber w   hrend wir auf hei   en kohlen sitzen, schleicht die katze statt unsereiner    ber sie   8222;like a cat on hot bricks quot; oder    ber  8216;s hei   e blechdach:   8222;like a cat on a hot tin roof quot;.wo es bei uns bindf   den regnet, regnet es in england hunde und katzen   8222;it  8216;s raining cats and dogs quot; und ich mu    gestehen, das w   re mir gar nicht recht. auch die redewendung   8222;there  8216;s more then one way to skin a cat quot; (w   rtl.    bers. es gibt mehr als einen weg, der katze das fell    ber die ohren zu ziehen) f   r mehrere m   glichkeiten, etwas zu erledigen, finde ich ebenfalls abscheulich.sehr wahr allerdings ist   8222;keep no more cats then will catch mice quot; (w   rtl.    bers. halte nicht mehr katzen, als m   use zum fangen da sind) die warnung, jemanden zu unterst   tzen, der unwillig oder unf   hig ist, dasselbe f   r einen zu tun. verwendete oder nicht verwendete, aber gelesene quellen:http://www.doghause.com/idioms2.htmlhttp://www.serve.com/shea/spruch.htmhttp://staff-www.uni-marburg.de/~naeser/ss94-01.htm.http://campus.evcc.ctc.edu/departments/wrldlang/dstewart/ prover1.htm.http://www.zooplus.de/zooclub.asp?t=1241.http://www.katzenart.de/redens.htmhttp://www.kapege.de/sudel.php.http://www.imparola.de/vokabeln/proverbs.txtwem nun der kopf schwirrt, darf sich nun zum abschluss mit einem zungenbrecher vollends aus dem lot bringen:  8222;die katze tritt die treppe krumm - der kater tritt sie gerade quot;(w   rtl.    bers.: the cat walks the staircase curved, the tom-cat walks it flat again)wer meiner sammlung redewendungen, idioms oder spr   che hinzuf   gen m   chte, bediene sich bitte der kommentarspalte     leaofrafiki 4.05.2003  gt;^o^ lt;

f1 - 2001 season ......this op is not intended a a race by race appraisal . should you want these , there are plenty of ops available from the likes of c.haggler , that you should read , just check them out .what this op intends to do is supply an easy to read race by race index of final qualifying and final race results , plus the final standings of both racers and constructors at the end of the season . to this end , only the top ten per race will be listed .the 2000 season saw ferrari again run away with the constructors championship , and with michael schumacher , also the drivers championship . hence the 2001 season was billed as a catch-up season test for the remaining teams . this was sadly not to be , with michael schumacher again winning this seasons championship , this time with an even more commanding performance , beating his nearest rival , david coulthard , by almost 2:1 , and third placed man ( and fellow team-mate ) rubens barrichello , by just other the 2:1 ratio .add to this that with regards the constructors championship , that ferrari were the only team to score in all 2001 races , and what do you get ,  yep you guessed it , only one team in with a shout . in fact if it hadn   t of been for reliability problems suffered by barrichello towards the end of the season , then it almost certainly would have been a whitewash ( or is it scarletwash ) for the italian giants .the only thing ferrari failed to monopolise was the now allowed traction control , an area that was ruled by benetton of all teams . the only other and highly unusual thing to happen this year , was the sacking of frentzen by jordan , who promptly signed up prost   s driver alesi , leaving prost to sign up frentzen . a right merry-go-round there . you will note this from the belgium results onwards .now next year sees the allowance of direct computer control of the internal mechanics of an engine , via the pit lane . this i see as a further advantage for the big time spenders such as ferrari and mcclaren . the lower end outfits such as minardi and arrows just aren   t going to be able to compete , so making next season an almost foregone conclusion . however , with the emergence of the new yamaha team , and honda concentrating on just one team next year , there may just be some excitement ahead. additionally , renault have now taken overall control of benetton , which can only lead to improvements for the once all conquering team . lets hope so .sadly , next year we will not have the familiar faces of mika hakkinen and jean alesi , with alesi retiring and hakkinen taking a years sabbatical from racing . this of course means new drivers emerging , as well as a few  team swaps , which i will report upon prior to the start of next years racing .before concentrating on the race statistics of this year , i will start with listing next years f1 agenda ( note the only major change being the french and british g.p   s swapping positions ) . why we have a european g.p is beyond me ,as it now seems to held in germany almost every year ( we have two suitable circuits here now ). why not simply call it the german 2 g.p. the dates are as follows :2002 formula 1 championship calendarmarch 3      -  australia  , melbournemarch 17     -  malaysia   , sepangmarch 31     -  brazil     , interlagosapril 14     -  san marino , imolaapril 28     -  spain      , barcelona may 12       -  austria    , a1-ringmay 26       -  monaco     , monte carlojune 9       -  canada     , montrealjune 23      -  european   , nurburgring july 7       -  britain    ,  silverstone july 21      -  france     , magny-coursjuly 28      -  germany    , hockenheimaugust 18    -  hungary    , budapestseptember 1  -  belgium    , spa-francorchampsseptember 15 -  italy      , monza,september 29 -  usa        , indianapolis october 13   -  japan      , suzuka ok , so onto this years race qualifying / results ( top ten only ) :auatralia - qualifying :m.schumacher, barrichello , hakkinen , frentzen , r. schumacher , coulthard , trulli , villeneuve, panis , heidfeld. auatralia - race result1 michael schumacher                 ferrari  2 david coulthard                    mcclaren3 rubens barrichello                 ferrari  4 nick heidfeld                      sauber5 heinz-harald frentzen              jordan6 kimi raikkonen                     sauber7 olivier panis                      b.a.r. 8 luciano burti                      jaguar9 jean alesi                         prost10 jos verstappen                    arrows  gt;

gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;finally , my suggestions with regards what i would like to see introduced in the future :1) points for qualifying , as per champ car racing2) re-working of race results points scoring , currently : 1st - 10pts , 2nd - 6pts , 3rd - 4pts , 4th - 3pts , 5th - 2pts , 6th -1 pt.i would like to see the top 10 rewarded with points from 10 for 1st , through to 1 for 10th ( and the same for qualifying ) , thus making for a more exciting outcome , and often meaning that the last race of the season isn   t the usual foregone conclusion .3) race venues randomly drawn .i   m sure japan are fed up with being the last race of each season ( note point 2) raised ) .

thank you for the music the songs they re singingthanks for all the joy they re bringingwho can live without it, we ask in all honesty, what would life be, without a song and a dance what are weso thank you for the musicthis one chorus sums up abba - total cheese but also very listenable and very entertainingthis album was released as the album to accompany the movie in 1977 when abba were at the peak of their success and contains the 2 uk  1s  quot;take a chance on me quot; and  quot;the name of the game quot;.it also has my favourite abba album track  quot;move on quot; which again is pure pop, but branches out into rock  quot;hole in your soul quot; and  country rock   quot;eagle quot; although everything has a pop shean.the last three songs were part of an aborted musical but thank you for the music. i wonder, and i m a marionette are all far classier than andrew lloyd webber and are again all excellent.if you love pop - you ll love abba.if you love abba - this is their best album

this is abba s 1st hit album released to showcase the high quality europop of eurovision winner  quot;waterloo quot;, which encapsulates the whole abba sound in its 3 minutes with the uptempo pop and the girls voices harmonising magnificently.the rest of the cd is a mixed bag with the songs not always focusing o these strengths, and in several cases the boys are more to the fore than agnitha and frida - a crime in anyone s books.other good tracks are  quot;hasta manana quot;,  quot;honey honey quot;,  quot;king kong song quot; and  quot;what about livingstone quot; all of which stick to the developing abba formula.when its good its very very good, and when its bad its still ok

before kd lang hit the big time she was producing excellant albums such as this where her long time love of nashville was mixed with the torch song stylings she perfected on ingenuine.it s been said that kd is the reincarnation of elvis, and here you can see why - the voice ranges from swooning on  quot;trail of broken hearts to the country rock on  quot;big boned girls quot;  if you think you don t like country music - listen to this album, all the stylings are there, including the required lap steel, but kd lang and the reclines have removed the scmaltz and made this accessable to everyone

there was a time in the middle of 1995 when canada s alanis morissette was the next big thing, an astonishing caterwaul of pre-menstrual fury, powerful and seething, exuding purest venom with a nice line input downs, mainly of the male sex.  she had a lengthy career as a phenomenal child prodigy back home, so it shouldn t have come as any great surprise, yet when chris evans played the track you oughta know with its near the knuckle lyrics  quot;i want you to know that i m happy for you, i wish nothing but the best for you both, an older version of me, is she perverted like me? would you go down on you in a theatre? quot;evans played it for the titillation factor, but quickly slagged her off as a moaning minnie, but the lines certainly struck a chord with the public, as did the bleeped out bit which went  quot;are you thinking of me when you f*** her? quot;fact is, women don t talk like this in rock music, and the double whammy of a foul mouthed chick and her punk metal image sealed her arrival in a startling manner.the shock horror headlines would have been enough for a temporary emergence, but as it was morissette had a bunch of truly wonderful songs in her handbag and she was quite prepared to dance round them at the disco of our souls.  it was deep and meaningful and very soulful, but the most overriding impression was the one of total, spiteful rage, rebelling against the everyday laws which mean that women can t enjoy sex or talk like that.morissette definitely did the second and her knowing looks hinted that she could also manage the first and we loved her for it.sadly (or perhaps happily) for her, the album jagged little pill which showcased her material that year was an enormous platinum smash, but she seemed to fade just as quickly from view as she emerged.  she is still around and turning out the sort of stuff she produced back then, but has never recaptured the glorious rush of that first album, a blistering collection of tracks and a spawn of hits which had her on every magazine cover, the queen of the mtv generationmorissette was aided and abetted in her achievement by glenn ballard who produced, helped out on crafting the music and offered guitars, keyboards and programming, and it was very much a joint affair.  morissette provided some harmonica, and the album also featured dave navarro (guitar), flea (bass), benmont tench (organ) and matt laug (drums) among the faceless studio team.it was a well realised and powerful album, uniformly good with enough edge to keep even the hardest critics amused for hours.  it was hard to like the self indulgent and spiky morissette, but it was impossible to ignore her talent or her songs.  morissette promised much with this epic, but had burned too brightly too quickly for her own good, and soon became a figure of fun for the same critics who had lauded her so highly.still, one great album is certainly better than none, and jagged little pill is undoubtedly a great album. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;all i really want gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;this was a great, blasting opening number, setting out her stall with standard signature pieces, quirky phrasing and treated voices over huge slabs of hard american rock.  it wasn t orthodox, but it was intensely powerful.   quot;enough about me, let s talk about you for a minute, enough about you, let s talk about life for a while. quot;all i really want is one of the strongest numbers on the album and simply drips with anger, a brilliant opener. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;you oughta know gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;if all i really want was amazing, then you oughta know goes a whole heap further, truly one of the great female rock numbers of the last decade.  i ve already filled you in on the shock aspects of those lyrics, but don t get the impression that there s nothing else here.  bubbling bass undercurrents, manic, spitting, almost disturbed singing, battering, hard as diamond drums and guitar, and an atmosphere you could carve with a knife, this song has it all, together with a neat change in mood and dynamics part the way through which shows the musical control which contrasts so starkly with the paranoid and bitter mood.  this song is about sex and lust and betrayal, and reminds you of nothing so much as early elvis costello, although with far more authenticity and realism. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;perfect gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;after the harsher and angry fire of the previous two tracks, perfect is quieter and more restrained in mood, although its subject matter is no less fiery, telling the tale of dominant and demanding parents, perhaps a hint of autobiographical fury at her own child prodigy past.   quot;be a good girl, you ve gotta try a little harder, that simply wasn t good enough to make us proud. quot;  she knows her stuff does morissette, and this is a thoroughly effective song, despite its restraint. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;hand in my pocket gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;another brilliant single, hand in my pocket sports a quirky, jangling sound over some booming bass and snappy drums, with urgent, breathless vocals, cod-dylan mouth organ and a wonderful atmosphere.  it has none of the bitter fury found elsewhere on jagged little pill, but is nevertheless a great, invigorating number. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;right through you gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;more spiteful put downs:  quot;you took me for a joke, you took me for a child, you took a long hard look at my ass, and then played golf for a while. quot;  morissette is the ms angry and bitter of rock and roll and has certainly built up more than her fair share of resentment.  again the musical mood is relatively restrained and gentle, but the venom oozes from every pore, as she gives all the hangers on and putters down the vicious finger. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;forgiven gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;this time it s religion,  quot;the saviours, the loverless priests quot; who get the rap.  a good rock melody is harnessed to press home the message, while morissette gets almost histrionic, but there s enough peaks and troughs of mood here to keep the interest -  quot;in the name of the father, the skeptic and the son, i had one more stupid question. quot;  all the years of blind obedience and death in the name of religion are given short shrift. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;you learn gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;more insanity and loathing, i m afraid:  quot;i recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone, i recommend walking around naked in your living room, swallow it down (what a jagged little pill), it feels so good (swimming in your stomach), wait until the dust settles. quot;  however, it s a wonderfully attractive mid-paced number with distinctive vocals, and an addictive beat and melody. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;head over feet gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;this is a strange oddity here - a song with words which are quite (whisper it) happy:  quot;you re the best listener that i ve ever met, you re my best friend, best friend with benefits, what took me so long.  i ve never felt this healthy before, i ve never wanted something rational, i am aware now. quot;  it s a thoroughly optimistic, honest to goodness love song, and quite delightful.  if only morissette could have cut little gems like this in with the anger she d have been so much stronger a muse.  the music and playing are gentler than a lot of the other stuff, but there s still enough power to keep you enthralled. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;mary jane gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;jingle jangle acoustic sets an almost mamas and papas style opening theme, and the whole piece has that distinctly timeless 60s west coast feel for the most part, with morissette showing what a great singer she can be if she lets go of all the rage and concentrates on it.  the voice is powerful and moving, cutting straight to the quick, although this isn t one of the better songs here, for all its gentle pleasures. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;ironic gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;this number explores the ironies of life -  quot;a traffic jam when you re already late, a no smoking sign on your cigarette break, it s like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife, it s meeting the man of my dreams and then meeting his beautiful wife. quot;  the mood is wistful and reflective, again relying on acoustic guitar for its gentler parts, while the hard rock of the chorus always drags you screaming away from the peace.  still, it s a nicely staged piece which you d find hard to dislike. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;not the doctor gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;a clever, clipped guitar riff punctuates the whole of this song, urging us on over restrained drums and neat bass.  i love this song, although it s not as immediate as some of the other stuff here. gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;wake up gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;a wonderfully understated opening ushers in another quite outstanding track with some more great vocals and an almost distant, unsettling faraway mood.then the album closes with an ominous, threatening version of you oughta know which wends its way over an astonishing five minutes of sheer tension and pain, before the ubiquitous mystery track at the end, delivered in a breathless a capella, unadorned and raw, a suitable end indeed to a blistering album from a wonderful talent.

when you open the lycos.co.uk you have a logo of a little dog where you click to play the game fetch that when it is opened the little dog shows you where you have to go to click and you have nine chances to click the little icons. it is very difficult to win something there, and i would say that the real game is to take you to their page to make people play and than with more and more people going to lycos they will be making lots and lots of money.that s what is about really,because you can see at the list of the winners that is just pure luck that they got the prize.

since starting to read pratchett novels i have always wanted to see the vampires fighting. at last in this novel you can. the story follows the witches going into battle with the vampires, but not directly. more of a psycological battle. the king invites vampires into the town, and granny wetherwax gets worried. she has known this would happen, so when granny dissapears and leaves nanny and agnes to fend for themselves the plot thickens. pratchett writes this novel like the very first one; superb and full to the brim  i love his books and cannot wait for each sequal. well done terry

chris benoit came to the wwf from wcw along with dean malenko, perry satun and eddie guerrero forming the radicalz. chris claims to be the best technical wrestler in the wwf but is it true? i don t think it is hes only won the intercontinental title although hes won it more than once. he s never captured the wwf title although hes tried when you have wrestlers out there like triple h, stone cold, the rock, i think any of them can be more technical than benoit.benoit and his team of radicalz are proberly the most powerful gorup in the wwf and in my opinon are full of the reject wrestlers especiall dean and perry. i don t think any of these wrestlers are entertaining to watch. at least at the moment one of them could leave. with eddie and chris having a falling out chris is really pissed off and doesn t want eddie near him and given the chance would beat the crap out him. chris benoits most famous move is the cripler crossface and normally forces even the rock and triple h to tap out.

polgara the sorceress is the book that all fans of this series have been waiting for.  it finally fills in some of those niggling little gaps missing from the belgariad, the malloreon and belgarth the sorcerer.i particularly enjoyed this book as it is written from polgara   s point of view, with her irony and no nonsense approach to life.it tells the story from the beginning (from polgara   s point of view at least), and shows us a little girl growing up into a world filled with magic, searching for her    purpose    and finally maturing in the woman we know and love from the previous books.this is the story of polgara   s life, from growing up in the vale of aldur, to losing her twin to the rivan king and finally the seemingly endless succession of heirs to the rivan throne, culminating in garion, the godslayer.if you enjoyed reading the previous books as much as me, this is definitely one you cannot miss out

i think that we should have the right to decide if we want to watch bbc and if we do, then we should have to pay the license fee, and if you like me don t then you shouldn t have to. i think it is not right to pay for something you may not always watch.we subscribe to sky, and think that we have enough channels that keep us occupied not to miss the bbc that much. let me think what i watch on the bbc, match of the day, which is soon going to itv, formula one, which has gone, and the odd episode of neighbours and eastenders. i m sure i ll live without them.for the bbc, to receive so much money from the license fees and the government, they fail time and again to win the rights to sporting fixtures, if thy hadn t they we would not all need to have sky installed and pay even more money .i m not saying that their should be no bbc, just that we should have the right to choose if we want to watch them channels, and if not, then we don t need to pay the license fee. at the moment we subscribe to the sky package which does not include the movie channels, so since we don t pay for them, we don t watch them.surely what i am  saying must have logic. the bbc had it s advantages but now it is on a downward spiral, the final straw for me was when they lost the rights for motd. i don t mind adverts in between my viewing, it gives me time to pop to the toilet or make a brew

cults and fanitics by colin and damon wilsonthis story gives details of mass murderers and cults ranging from the assains to the kkk to the yorkshire ripper. it discusses how their ideas became formed, who followed them and why. this book is a fascinating and gives insights into the behaviour of human beings. from those who worship the devil right through to those who take their lives to reach a different planet. it takes you into society that is not familiar to what is ours. i would recommend this book who is intrested in a cult.

in the beginning....over 40 years ago, cliff richard s backing band, the shadows, (now consisting of hank marvin, bruce welch and brian bennett), had the number one hit,  apache  (uk no. 1 for six weeks and helped inspire artists such as eric clapton and mark knopfler). this was the start of a hugely successful music career and now, the band has reunited for the first time in 15 years for their final tour.promoting their new album, the shadows and their millions of fans, will celebrate being one of the most talented bands in the history of british music. their new album features all their previous hits, and a new track called  life story , which was the last song ever written by jerry lordan, who wrote earlier hits such as  apache  and  wonderful land .track listing:-disc 1:apacheman of mysteryshadoogie  83shindigwonderful landthe rise and fall of flingel buntthe boysthe theme from  quot;the deerhunter quot; (cavatina)the frightened citytheme for young loversdance onthe savagealbatrossf.b.i.guitar tangogenie with the light brown lampatlantisfoot tapperdon t cry for me argentinakon-tikitelstarthe third mangeronimoequinoxe (part v)the strangerriders in the skydisc 2:mountains of the moonmoonlight shadowyou win againmemory (from  cats )i guess that s why they call it the bluesthing-me-jiglife storyjohnny stacattosummer love  59turning pointthis old housechariots of firecrockett s theme (from  miami vice )midnight creepin going home (theme from  local hero )every breath you takeafricawalk of lifedancing in the darkoriginality:-although          pictures

we bought my mum a set of ghd hair-straighteners for christmas, and she can t live with-out them they are brilliant.she uses them near enough every day, and takes them on holiday to. they are so much better than the hair straighteners you buy in argos like the babyliss.all she does is comb her her and then she starts from the top and squezzes the ceramic plates together and pulls them down her hair and walla, she has straight her. we got them around about 2 years ago and they are still going strong. she was very impressed when she opened her present and found these .they don t only straighten hair they can curl as well. and that is easy to do as you do the same procedure as straightning but you wrap the hair round the straightners and pull. we got her a set, which she got a ghd hair spray and some putty stuff and she loved it a christmas dream came true.we bout them for    130,00 but now you can get them for about    85-   100

underclass hero is the first studio album without brownsound (dave baksh) and in my opinion they dont need him because this album is superb. and you really dont seem to noticed that he has gone sounds different from their past two albums  quot;does this look infected? quot; and  quot;chuck quot; but fans of  quot;all killer..no filler quot; will love this because this is sum 41 returning to their pop punk style. sounds like old sum 41 but grown up, but you ll still be singing along from start to finish  some of the songs like  quot;underclass hero quot; and  quot;march of the dogs quot; shows the bands political opinions which i wasnt too crazy about and reminded me of green days  quot;american idiot quot;. but apart from that this a fab album
